MPs have shot down Treasury’s proposal to create the National Housing Development Fund that would have seen employers and employees contribute a percentage of their pay. The MPs rejected attempts to have Kenyans in formal employment contribute 0.5 per cent of their pay to the housing development fund as indicated in the Finance Bill 2018. Treasury Secretary Henry Rotich had, in his Budget Statement in June, pegged the levy at 0.5 per cent of an individual’s pay. This would be matched by a similar contribution from employers up to a maximum of Sh5,000. The State Department of Housing announced two months ago that it was finalising regulations to operationalise a housing development fund, whose finer details are yet to be released. This is the first time that the Housing ministry was establishing the fund that has been lying dormant in the Housing Act for decades. Its implementation meant an employee earning Sh100,000 would contribute Sh500 every month to the fund – up to the maximum Sh5,000 for those earning Sh1 million and above. The creation of the fund would have helped the government realise the goal of delivering half a million affordable housing units in five years.
