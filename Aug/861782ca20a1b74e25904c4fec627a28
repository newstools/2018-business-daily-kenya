Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) has denied announcing an increase in payment rates to farmers countrywide in the just concluded financial year. The tea agency also denounced claims that they have increased the month payment of green leaf from Sh15 to Sh25 per kilogramme delivered to factories. In a notice in the local daily, the agency said the circular distributed to various farmers was fake and should be disregarded. “Please note that KTDA factory boards have not announced the second payment figure or any increase in monthly rates,” the notice stated. It also emphasised that the information was intended to create disharmony between the farmers and their respective boards. This came after the management of Kiru Tea factory in Murang’a said it would increase farmers pay by Sh10 in a bid to dissuade the farmers from selling their produce to brokers. KTDA approval The management of the factory said the increment had been approved by the KTDA board. Directors of KTDA-managed factories are set to meet in September to deliberate on the performance of their respective factories and decide on the payment to farmers. The tea agency advised that once the directors have met and discussed their rates, payments for each factory will be published in the national media, KTDA website and on their official social media accounts. “Any adjustment to the monthly rates payable to farmers is deliberated by all stakeholders and approved by factory boards before adoption,” the notice further stated.
