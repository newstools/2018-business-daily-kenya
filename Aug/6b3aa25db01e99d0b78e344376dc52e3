Elders want Kenya Airports Authority to pay Sh26 billion as compensation for Kisumu International Airport land which was acquired in 1942. Kogony Council of Elders has petition the National Lands Commission for payment of land acquired for the facility. Speaking on behalf of the council, Hillary Awino accused the government of reneging on a promise to pay them after acquiring 880 acres of land. Mr Awino was speaking during the NLC sitting at Kisumu Social Hall on Thursday. He said the claim is based on an valuation conducted in 2006. “It is unfortunate for the government to retreat on an agreement reached mutually while members of the community continue to live in abject poverty,” he told the four-member NLC committee investigating historical land injustices. Mr Awino said that land which was bought in Muhoroni to resettle over 2,000 families evicted from the airport site had been taken over by over 326 “mysterious” families. KAA lawyer David Otieno said Kogony community members gave out the land voluntarily, adding that the government, and not KAA, should pay the amount. “The KAA came later and is not privy to the agreement reached between the two parties. The government allocated the land to KAA and they should not bear the cost of compensation,” he told the committee. It emerged that the Kogony community gave out over 500 acres of their ancestral land in 1914 and another 373 acres in 1942 for the facility. Paul Otieno, chairman of the council, appealed to the NLC committee led by Samuel Tororei to look into their grievances and ensure that they get justice. “Courts have failed us and we hope to get reprieve from the commission,” said Mr Otieno. Mr Tororei pledged to follow up on the issue to the satisfaction of both parties. NLC said it was seeking redress for citizens who suffered historical land injustices between June 1895 and August 30, 2010.
