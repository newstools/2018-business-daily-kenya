The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has launched a manhunt for nine people linked to fraud at Kenya Power. The DCI on Friday requested members of the public to inform the unit concerning the whereabouts of the nine whose arrest warrants have since been issued. The suspects include Catherine Wanjiku Njuguna, Christine Nyawara, Edwin Macharia Ngamini of Mallous Enterprises, and John Waweru of Kazimix Enterprises. Others are Jason Morara, James Ongechi, Jeremiah Onduko of Jake Building and Construction Ltd, Stephen Njoroge Maina and Linet Njeri. The nine are wanted for fraudulent acquisition of Kenya Power properties. The DCI has further requested the public with any helpful information about the suspects to report the cases at the Milimani Anti-Corruption Court No.1 or at the DCI Kenya offices. Last month the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji ordered for the arrest of several Kenya power staff and top managers over procurement of defective transformers and the irregularities in prequalifying 525 companies for labour and transport contracts. The case is currently before the court.
