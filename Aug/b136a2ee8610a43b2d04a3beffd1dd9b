Work stoppage on the rehabilitation of the Karatina open air market in Nyeri County continued for the third week, with no end in sight. About 150 workers at the multimillion-shilling market downed their tools three weeks ago, complaining they had not been paid for months. The workers have declined to resume duty until their dues are paid. The market has been under construction for nearly a decade and has stalled multiple times. On Tuesday a spot-check at the site established there was no activity going on. Site manager Mr Rodgers Kimahara, an employee of the contractor High Point Agencies, recently confirmed that work had halted. He could not, however, indicate when work is expected to resume. The project had been slated for inauguration by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday next week. However, at a function in the county on Sunday, Deputy President Mr William Ruto said he and President Uhuru Kenyatta would both inaugurate the market “in the next one or two months” Mr Ruto spoke during a fundraiser at Mathaithi PCEA Church near Karatina town.
