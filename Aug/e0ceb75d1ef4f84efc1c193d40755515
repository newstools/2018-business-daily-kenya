Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has confronted detractors who question her source of wealth by declaring her net worth, as Kanu rebuked her for linking retired President Daniel arap Moi to “historic looting”. In a TV interview, the governor said she is not a billionaire as most Kenyans think, adding that she is worth less than Sh300 million. Ms Waiguru was recently ranked as the second most corrupt leader in the country after Deputy President William Ruto by research firm Ipsos Synovate. Ms Waiguru maintains that she is not corrupt and has never been charged in court despite being linked to the 2016 National Youth Service scandal that led to the loss of Sh791 million. She questioned the validity of the Ipsos poll pointing to the fact she was ranked above former President Moi on corruption. “It (the poll) also ranked me above the former President Moi, who ruled this country for 24 years… I mean, how ridiculous can it get? Everybody knows what we think about the Moi era. Are you saying that I stole more than Moi?” she said.

The Governor should carry her own cross,” Kanu said on Thursday. Ms Waiguru said: “The people I am being ranked with are multi-billionaires. You can’t compare that with less than Sh300 million.”
