A politician’s son who was enraged after his car was involved in a minor road accident and shot dead an innocent motorist 10 years ago faces arrest for failure to pay Sh12 million in compensation to his victim’s family. The deputy registrar of the High Court’s civil division issued the warrant against Albert Kubai, son of former Imenti North MP Nteere Mbogori, over failure to pay the family of Benjamin Edward Rahedi as ordered by the court five years ago. “Whereas the named person was adjudged by a decree of this court in a compensation suit on October 14, 2013 to pay to the decree-holder the sum of Sh12,311,401, which remains unpaid, these are to command you to arrest the said and unless he shall pay the monies plus interest together with executing expenses as well as fees, if any, to bring the judgment debtor before court with all convenient speed,” the warrant reads. The registrar directed court orderlies to return the copy of the warrant as soon as it is executed or the monies while indicating the day on which and manner has been executed, or reason why it has not been executed. In 2013, High Court judge Hatari Waweru ordered him to compensate the family of Mr Rahedi the money which has since attracted an interest.
