Nine secondary schools in western region identified as model institutions for science, technology, engineering and mathematics have received materials and kits for teaching robotic science from next term. Twenty-seven teachers from the schools in Kakamega, Vihiga, Bungoma and Busia attended a week-long training at the Sacred Heart Mukumu Girls Secondary in Kakamega County. Each of the schools received a set of the EV 3 robotic kits for teaching and learning, two laptops and a camera to facilitate the lessons. The teachers have been tasked to identify learners with interest in technology and innovations and ensure the learning processing is integrated in normal school curriculum. The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programme was launched in 2016 to encourage learners to enhance creativity and innovation. The Centre for Mathematics, Science, Technology, Education in Africa (CEMASTEA) is implementing the programme on behalf of the Ministry of Education. A trainer Mr Kennedy Otieno, said: “The trainings have been designed to prepare learners to innovate and come up with practical solutions to problems bedevilling our communities in their rural setup.” For instance, a project on assembling a robot by teachers from Namenya Gsirls Secondary in Budalangi constituency focused on the menace of monkey raiding farms in the village and destroying maize and food crops. The team was able to assemble a robot configured to use sensors to detect the presence of monkeys, birds and other wild animals on the farms and set off an alarm that scares them away. Mr Christopher Ogutu and his colleagues from the school said the robotic scarecrow was not harmful to the wild animals. “Unlike pesticides the gadget is friendly to the environment.”
