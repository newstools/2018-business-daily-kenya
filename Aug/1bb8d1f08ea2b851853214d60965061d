Benson Kilonzi is the fourth winner of the seven apartments up for grabs in Safaricom’s   Maisha Ni M-Pesa Tu promotion. The ongoing promotion began four weeks ago. Seven of M-Pesa’s 28.6 million customers stand to win an apartment and eight of 150,000 agents could win Sh1m in float. Mr Kilonzi, a farmer and mason in Kitui’s Ithumula village, wins a Sh7.8m property in Nairobi’s Kahawa West neighbourhood off Thika Road. “I remember the day I received a call that I had won a house. I was digging a pit latrine for one of my neighbours in Ithumula. This is certainly a life-changing win for my entire family and me as the casual jobs I do cannot sufficiently feed my family nor build a descent house,” said the 46-year-old Mr Kilonzi. The father of two receives payments for his masonry services via M-Pesa and borrows money from M-Shwari often to pay for his children school fees. Those who help support his children’s education also send him school fee via M-Pesa. Safaricom Regional Sales and Operations  Director Steve Okeyo said the company launched the promotion to reward customers for their support. Other apartment winners include Jeniffer Kathure - a Khat trader from Meru, James Njagi - an artisan at Gikomba market, and Eric Lindenberg - a South African designer resident in Nairobi.
