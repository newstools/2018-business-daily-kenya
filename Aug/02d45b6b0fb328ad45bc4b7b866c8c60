The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has moved to court in a bid to recover 24 government houses valued at Sh420 million and land in Nakuru Town. The anti-graft agency has filed five suits at the Environment and Lands Court sitting in Nakuru to recover the land and houses located within the central business district saying they were illegally acquired. The EACC has obtained court orders to restrain nine people and three companies from taking over the property which it says belongs to the Ministry of Housing. “The defendants are hereby barred from alienating, selling, transferring, charging, developing, leasing, sub-dividing or dealing with any of the properties pending hearing and determination of the suits in court,” read part of the court order dated July 31. The EACC filed the suits before Justice Dalmas Ohungo on July 24. Individuals sued include former Lands Commissioner Wilson Gachanja. Companies include Pembeni Ltd and Liberty Assurance Company Ltd. Justice Ohungo certified the matter as urgent and directed that the application be served to each party before it is heard. “It is hereby ordered that an inhibition be registered against the properties pending further orders by the court,” ruled Justice Ohungo. The court further ordered that the matter be heard on October 4 and 5. Meanwhile, the EACC has reclaimed a prime parcel of land belonging to the Postal Corporation of Kenya located along Moi Road, next to Tower One building, in Nakuru town. The anti-graft body said the parastatal had not transferred ownership of the plot worth about Sh200 million. A local politician had grabbed the land.
