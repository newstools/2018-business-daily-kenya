Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) has stopped supplying drugs to Narok and Migori counties over a Sh162 million debt. The agency has demanded that the counties clear the debt before resuming supply. Counties owe Kemsa Sh1.8 billion for medical supplies. Director of Commercial Services Eliud Muriithi however said they would resume supplies if counties and Kemsa agree on a payment plan. “We do not wish to deny the commodities to the counties and if they make plans and honour payments we will resume services. We will approach the counties if they do not approach us,” he said. Mr Muriithi was speaking during the flagging off of drugs worth Sh146 million to 102 hospitals in Nairobi County after City Hall promised to clear a Sh234 million debt. County Chief of Health Mahat Jimale said they would pay Sh30 million monthly to clear the debt. “We hope that through the plan we will continue receiving supplies,” Mr Jimale said. Nairobi’s new debt of Sh146 million however will be paid separately — on a quarterly basis. Kemsa last supplied Nairobi County drugs in February last year before stopping, which put a strain on the county’s hospitals. Nairobi has the highest debt of Sh234 million while Narok owes Kemsa Sh104 million and Migori Sh58 million. Murang’a County, which had a debt of Sh46 million, has paid Sh41 million. Kemsa gives counties a 45-day grace period, however some counties have not paid debts dating back to two years.
