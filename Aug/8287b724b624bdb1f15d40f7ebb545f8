A London court has sent back some 41,005 Kenyans who hoped to get compensation from Britain due to torture by the colonial government in the 1950s empty-handed. This group had expected to get a payout from the UK just like the 5,228 Kenyans, mostly Mau Mau veterans, who had sued earlier and got a total of Sh2.7 billion in an out-of-court settlement reached in 2013. The second batch of claimants will, however, not be entitled to a single cent after Justice Stewart of the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court said the time difference from the time the alleged atrocities happened and when the case was lodged was too long to enable a competent trial. The judge made the finding last Thursday at the end of the hearing of a test-case from one of the claimants, who was granted anonymity and only called TC34. The man had told the court that he was tortured during the State of Emergency that lasted between 1952 and 1959. He said he was interrogated and tortured after his arrest in 1954 and witnessed the violent rape of a girl. TC34 also said he was forced to work at Mackinnon Road, Mwea, and Gathigiri without remuneration and that he was once detained and sent to Embakasi despite not having been convicted. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the sued party, used the Limitation Act of 1980 to argue its case, which stipulates in its Section 33 that people who suffer personal injuries should sue not later than three years after they are harmed. Lawyers for the Kenyans tried to counter that argument by saying those suing were “illiterate. One of the reasons the Judge gave was that it would be hard for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to properly respond to the case as it had no “fair opportunity” to investigate the allegations.
