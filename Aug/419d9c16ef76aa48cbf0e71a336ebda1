Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has lent his support to ongoing demolitions by the National Environment Management Authority (Nema), saying that even he is not exempt from ongoing efforts to restore public land. The county boss says he will ensure that all property built on waterways, road reserves and riparian land is demolished. Sonko pointed out that the law should not be applied selectively, adding that he is ready to lead by example with his own property in Buru Buru which he admitted is on a road reserve. “Even myself, there is a land I bought in Buru Buru. About an acre of that land is part of road access and we shall start by demolishing that wall. It does not matter how well connected you are, if you have built on a road reserve or water ways, that structure has to go down,” said Sonko on Thursday. Sonko vowed to reclaim all grabbed land and public utilities in the devolved unit, warning that any county or Nema officials who have conspired with grabbers to approve building plans on public utilities will be prosecuted alongside suspected grabbers. He also went ahead to list several parcels and utilities in Nairobi that he alleged were grabbed. They include the proposed land for Gigiri and Ruaraka fire stations, Highridge Hospital in parklands, new Muthaiga Thigiri Ridge County dispensary and nursery school, Pumwani Hospital expansion structures, Eastleigh county Market and Wariro county market.
