Former senior Nairobi County employees charged alongside Evans Kidero over the loss of Sh213 million through fraudulent deals were yesterday released on stringent bail terms in contrast with the former governor. Senior principal magistrate anti-corruption court Lawrence Mugambi directed each of the nine to deposit a bond of Sh3 million with one surety of the same amount, without an option of a cash bail as granted to Mr Kidero and former head of finance Maurice Okere. In addition, each was directed to sign a declaration to attach their property worth Sh5 million should they breach the bond terms. They were also asked to deposit their travel documents with the court. “Besides the Sh3million each of you is required to sign a personal cognisance of Sh5 million meaning that if either of you fails to turn up for your trials you will pay the government that amount of money. In case you do not have the Sh5 million property worth the amount will be auctioned to recover the money or be jailed for a term the trial court deems fit,” Mr Mugambi told the victims. Mr Kidero was released on a cash bail of Sh2 million and a Sh3 million surety bond.
