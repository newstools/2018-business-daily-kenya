Forty seven people were on Wednesday charged at a Nakuru court with selling adulterated fuel at various places along the Nakuru-Eldoret highway. The suspects who appeared before Chief Magistrate Josephat Kalo faced two counts of selling petroleum fuel without licenses from the Energy Regulatory Commission as well as adulterating the commodity. According to the prosecution the suspects were found selling 880 litres of diesel without licenses from the ERC. The fuel was adulterated with kerosene, the prosecution said. According to the prosecution, the 47 are part of an organised black market dealers running depots where petrol and diesel, largely acquired through dubious means, are mixed with kerosene to reap huge profits while endangering the lives of millions of people and damaging thousands of vehicles and machines. The 47 were arrested on Monday by the General Service Unit officers who conducted a crackdown on various sites along the Nairobi-Nakuru-Eldoret highway at Pipeline and near Salgaa Trading Centre. They however, denied the charges. Tortured Mr John Ochang, the lawyer representing the suspects complained that his clients had been tortured by the GSU officers after they were arrested on Monday. According to Mr Ochang, the officers beat up the accused persons who were unarmed contrary to the law. He further urged the court to consider the conditions of the accused persons whom he said were innocent and were arrested while on their way to their homes. The court released them on Sh50,000 bond each with sureties of similar amounts. The case will be mentioned on August 24.
