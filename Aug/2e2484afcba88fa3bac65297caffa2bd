Former nominated Senator Joy Adhiambo Gwendo has agreed to return Sh1.7 million she is accused of stealing from a cooperative society in Kisumu. Appearing before the anti-corruption court in Nairobi on Monday, the former TNA senator pleaded guilty to charges of abuse of office and issuing bad cheques. In a plea bargain with the prosecution, the former legislator agreed to return the money in four instalments of Sh432,930. Sufficient funds Ms Gwendo admitted issuing a cheque of Sh300,000 in favour of Kisumu East Cotton Growers Cooperative Society through CFC Stanbic Kivuli’s development initiative’s account, yet she knew that the account did not have sufficient funds. The former legislator also admitted issuing another cheque on the same day worth Sh950,000. The court heard that she committed the offences on December 5, at her office at KICC building. Ms Gwendo further admitted that at on October 23, 2016 at Chiga Parish in Kisumu, she used her position as a State officer to confer herself the money belonging to the Sacco. Defer plea taking The former senator wanted the court to defer her plea taking until she settles the amount but the application was rejected by Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti. In the plea bargain, the DPP agreed to withdraw two counts of forgery and stealing. Ms Gwendo will now appear before the Magistrate on December 7 for sentencing. She was charged in court in February and denied five counts and was released on a Sh300,000 cash bail.
