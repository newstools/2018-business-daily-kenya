Equity Bank’s scholarship programme has this year reached a value of Sh11.13 billion since its inception in 2010. A total of 465 scholars have in that time secured admission to universities abroad. This year, 64 scholars will join prestigious universities such as Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Students secured scholarships provided through the universities and their partners such as Mastercard Foundation which average Sh2.4 million. The bank has further extended a stipend of between Sh100,000 and Sh200,000 to each of the scholars leaving the country, totalling Sh11.4 million. The programme draws its membership from the two top students from every county in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations as well as all scholars who score an A grade from within the bank’s Wings to Fly scholarship programme for academically gifted but financially challenged students. The 2018 cohort are part of a larger group of 12,236 scholars who have over the years been given an offer of a paid internship at Equity Bank and guidance on the application process for universities abroad. Speaking during the send-off ceremony, Equity Group CEO James Mwangi advised the scholars to exploit the opportunities for academic excellence, leadership training, networking and global exposure that the scholarships offer.
