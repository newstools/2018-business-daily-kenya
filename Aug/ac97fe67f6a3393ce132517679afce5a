A fishermen lobby at the Coast has defended fish imports such as tilapia and salmon from China saying it helps address shortage locally. Wavuvi Association of Kenya chairman Hamid Omar said there is a huge demand for fish in the country. “We can get enough fish in our waters but due to lack of modern fishing gears we cannot meet the huge demand which China is trying to address. More so, Chinese fish are cheaper compared to Kenyan,” Mr Omar said. However, he urged the government to equip fishermen with modern fishing gears to revamp the sector. Mr Omar said in Mombasa there were more than 50 landing sites that have been grabbed by land grabbers eying business from the port. “Like in Kibarani which used to be a landing site more than 50 acres of the sea which used to be a breeding site for crabs, lobster and prawns was grabbed by private developers. Fishermen should also be taught new fishing methods,” Mr Omar added. He also complained over brokers who are fleecing the fishermen at the fishing sites within the region. “They buy our fish and go sell at beach hotels at high prices. We also want the Ward Representatives and the six governors in the region to protect landing sites at the Coast from being grabbed,” Mr Omar said. Ban imports His remarks come as other Kenyan fishermen and traders urged the government to ban the imports. The traders protested the flooding of cheap imports which they say has skewed the local market. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has, in a past interview, said that the government cannot ban imported fish. “It is about supply and demand,” said the CS. Fish from China is cheaper compared to local catch with tilapia going for Sh150-Sh300 a kilo while the Kenyan variety goes for Sh400. Mr Omar said fish from Lake Victoria is the most expensive, forcing most households to rely on fish imports from the Asian countries. “Why would anyone sell tilapia at Sh500 while those from China goes for Sh200?” he asked.
