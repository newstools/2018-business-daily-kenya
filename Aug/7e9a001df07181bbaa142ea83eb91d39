Eritrean Airlines has begun regular flights to Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa, the Eritrean information minister said on Saturday, marking another step in improving relations between the Horn of African countries after a generation of hostility. Ethiopia’s state-affiliated media confirmed that a plane carrying Eritrean transport and tourism ministers and other officials had landed at Addis Ababa’s Bole international airport - the first time in two decades that such a flight had taken place, it said. “Upon arrival at Bole, Ethiopia’s State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hirut Zemene and other senior Ethiopian officials, welcomed the delegation,” the report by Fana Broadcasting Corporation said.

Abiy and Eritrea’s President Isaias Isaias Afwerki have already visited each other’s country.
