Vivo Energy launched three new Shell fuel formulations as it seeks to cement its position as the leading petroleum marketer in the country. Shell V-Power will be available in 95 Shell service stations while the Shell FuelSave Unleaded and FuelSave Diesel will be available at Shell stations across the country from Wednesday. The new formulations will also be available to industrial customers and commercial fleet owners. The fuels have been made through the Dynaflex technology that helps clean and protect key engine components, making them Shell’s most advanced formulations. “We hope motorists will experience the benefits of our new fuels, enhanced with our latest Dynaflex technology, so that they can enjoy better journeys on the road,” Vivo Energy Kenya Managing Director, Joe Muganda during the launch on Wednesday. Vivo’s move comes after Hass Petroleum partnered with Omani Oil to distribute lubricants formulated in Omani in Kenya and the East African region as the battle for Kenya’s petroleum market intensifies. A report by Petroleum Institute of East Africa ranked Vivo Energy as the leading player in the local market in the first quarter of the year at 28 per cent, followed by Kenol Kobil at 9.9 per cent.
