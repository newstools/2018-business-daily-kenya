Over 150,000 farmers in Makueni County will now access information on best farming practices, discounted inputs and credit services through their phones following the launch of DigiFarm. The programme has so far registered 120,000 farmers who have been trained on DigiFarm and can now access the service. The drive has so far covered Wote, Mbooni and Kibwezi East sub-counties with Kilome and Kaiti to be covered in August. To bring the services of quality input closer to the Makueni farmer, DigiFarm will open three depots in Wote, Kalawani and Mbumbuni .
