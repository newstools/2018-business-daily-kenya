Children with special needs will attend regular schools to enhance integrated learning and reduce stigma. Abdi Habat, director of Basic Education, said schools are segregated such that they cater for the deaf, visually impaired, those with autism, and the physically handicapped differently. “Surely, do we need a school just for children with physical handicaps? You can imagine 500 deaf and visually impaired children in one school. Are we saying they’re not part of the society? Can they not learn along with the others? Yet when these children reach university they go to the same institutions,” Mr Habat said. The Ministry of Education is following in the path of countries such as the UK, Australia, and the US which integrate children with disabilities in regular classes. Mr Habat said the move will give parents of children with special needs more school choices and increase the number of children accessing education. He said that about 852,000 children aged between six and 17 years were out of school, with a third being those living with disabilities. Many Kenyan children are denied access to mainstream schools and labelled mentally or physically retarded, he said.
