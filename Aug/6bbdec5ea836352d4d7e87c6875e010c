Senator Moses Kajwang wants Speaker Kenneth Lusaka to convene an urgent meeting to deliberate on allegations made by businessman Francis Mburu that four committee members solicited for Sh100 million during the probe on the controversial Ruaraka schools land. Mr Kajwang, who chairs the Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC) that investigated payment of Sh1.5 billion for the purchase of Drive Inn Primary School and Ruaraka High School land, asked Mr Lusaka to convene the Powers and Privileges Committee and summon Mr Mburu to substantiate allegations of impropriety. “We recommend that action be taken against any Senator who may have breached parliamentary privilege. Similarly, action should be taken against Francis Mburu if this allegations are unsubstantiated and are found to be in contempt of Parliament,” Mr Kajwang said at a Press conference in Parliament last evening. Reports emerged Monday that Mr Mburu had recorded statements with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations alleging that four members of the probe committee had solicited for Sh100 million to alter the outcome of the report in his favour. It is alleged that Mr Mburu has submitted an audio recording of the Senators soliciting the bribe money to the DCI for investigations. He said Mr Mburu, through his companies Afrison and Huelands Limited, sold government land to the same government. “The 13.7 acres acquired by the government in 2017 had been surrendered to the government for public utilities in 1984,” Mr Kajwang said.
