The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has extended the term of acting managing director Daniel Manduku for four months pending a competitive recruitment exercise. KPA said on Tuesday that the decision was based on his “impressive record” in the last two months, adding that the extension will afford the board sufficient time to recruit a substantive boss. “His term has been extended for four months pending recruitment of a substantive MD through an open, competitive and rigorous process,” KPA told the Business Daily. Dr Manduku was appointed to the position after the ouster of Catherine Wairi on May 30. His initial two-month contract lapsed on July 31 but the extension will now keep him at the busy parastatal up to November 30. The board has given him credit for enhanced efficiency at the port, increased cargo handling and a crackdown on illicit imports in collaboration with other agencies. According to Dr Manduku, the port generated Sh50 billion for the Kenya Revenue Authority in July, the highest in the history of KPA.
