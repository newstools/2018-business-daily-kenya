The Kericho County Assembly has temporarily stopped looming layoffs at the Kenya Tea Packers (Ketepa). Ketepa targeted 25 employees as it fights to contain costs amid rising competition. The company recently notified the Labour office its plans to slash its labour force citing redundancy and competition. Yesterday, 10 local legislators successfully petitioned Ketepa to suspend the sackings after they got wind of the plan. Speaking to the press after the close-door meeting at the Brooke headquarters, Assembly Speaker Dominic Rono disclosed that they had petitioned the company’s Human Resource Manager and Finance Officer to temporarily halt the retrenchment process. “The company argued that the targeted staff are redundant but we have reached a consensus that the process be suspended until a way forward is arrived at on how the process would be carried out. "As leaders we cannot allow injustice to be done under our watch. The company cannot carry out an arbitrary retrenchment process yet there are thousands of educated but jobless youths," added Mr Rono.
