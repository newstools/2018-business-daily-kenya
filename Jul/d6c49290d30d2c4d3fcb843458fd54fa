A visit to Lokichar by Petroleum and Mining secretary John Munyes and his Interior counterpart Fred Matiang'i Tuesday failed to unlock a stalemate that has halted oil operations in Turkana. Instead, Turkana leaders led by Governor Josphat Nanok issued fresh demands after residents initially blocked the early oil export plan to protest insecurity in the area. On Tuesday, the leaders demanded at least 100 professional jobs for Turkanas saying that was part of the deal brokered in the presence of President Uhuru Kenyatta in Lokichar town on May 19. Political leaders from Turkana had earlier met with the county security committee in Lodwar town. MPs James Lomenen and Mohammed Ali Lokiru, who supported the blocking of five oil trucks destined for Mombasa along Lokichar-Kapenguria highway last Wednesday, said the two Cabinet secretaries must address demands of residents and their leaders before oil transportation can resume.

"Residents are also waiting for Mr Munyes' assurance that there are jobs and that Tullow Oil is giving the host community its fair share of tenders," Mr Lomenen said. The MPs warned the CSs against giving residents empty promises about jobs, tenders and security of their livestock.
