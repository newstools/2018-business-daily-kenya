Former Nakuru County Health Executive, Dr Jonah Manjari, has been appointed to the helm of the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa). Dr Manjari replaces Fredrick Wanyonyi who has been serving at the State corporation in an acting capacity for over six months. He becomes the first medical doctor to head the drug supplies agency. His appointment takes effect from July 1, 2018. “We have selected a strong leader at a time when Kemsa is expected to effectively support the Ministry of Health in implementing Universal Health Care coverage by providing quality medical supplies,” Kemsa board chair Andrew Onyach said while speaking at the corporation’s headquarters. Dr Manjari will be tasked with steering the parastatal's growth amid a reputational crisis after its officers were accused of supplying expired drugs to the Kenyan market. “Kemsa is a premier organisation with a big mandate and we must ensure that we do our best to fulfil it,” the new CEO said of his appointment. Dr Manjari also worked as Kiambu County Health Executive where he spearheaded the upgrading of Kiambu and Gatundu Level Four Hospitals to Level Five status. He holds a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery from the University of Nairobi (UoN). He also has a Masters in Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Surgery from the same university and over 20 years work experience.
