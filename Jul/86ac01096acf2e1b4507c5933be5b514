Small scale gold miners in Migori County are set to receive safety shafts as the government begins to address dangers in mining. Mining Principal Secretary John Omenge said the government was committed to addressing challenges in the mining sector. "I can confirm that the government will soon introduce modern and safe mining shafts that will go a long way in curbing cases of injuries and death as a result of pits caving in as miners go about their activities," Mr Omenge told a workshop on mining in Migori. The seminar brought together stakeholders from Kenya, Ethiopia and Canada. Mr Omenge said that the shafts will be delivered in about two months and will go towards supporting women who engaged in pit mining. "With this new technology miners will be able to earn a decent living from the industry which has had myriad challenges for long. The ministry will pump enough funds into the project to ensure it succeeds," Mr Omenge said.
