The hospitality industry financier is set to lend Sh500 million to hotels that target tourists with experiential adventures. Tourism Finance Corporation (TFC) managing director Jonah Orumoi said a recent survey found hotels and other tourist facilities that offer outdoor activities enjoy higher revenues. “Tourists come here to enjoy deep sea diving but we are urging local investors to inject fund into the construction of floating boat-hotels that could serve food and beverages to the divers. Our hotel operators must diversify to remain relevant in this fast-changing tourism market,” he said. Mr Orumoi said the funding would help in the launch of new tourism products to attract tourists and spur repeat visits. He noted paragliding, bungee-jumping, cultural events and sports tourism are popular with tourists. In the past three years, said Mr Orumoi, the number of tourists has been rising reaching 1.4 million last year, enabling hotels to repay Sh250 million TFC loans while others are still repaying Sh380 million.

Mr Orumoi said four TFC-funded hotels in major towns along the standard gauge railway are under construction while another in Laikipia is almost complete. Mr Orumoi said 500 global investors in the tourism sector had confirmed attendance in the 2018 Africa Hotel Investment Forum in October. He urged counties and local investors to market tourist attractions and facilities at the event.
