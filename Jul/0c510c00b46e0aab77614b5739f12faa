Workers at the Kenyatta National Hospital have threatened to down their tools on the first week of August following non-payment of their health service allowances. Through their umbrella body, the Kenya Union of Domestic Hotels Educational Institutions and Hospital workers (Kudheiha), the staff have written to the hospital's chief executive informing the administration of their impending industrial action. The letter was in response to a botched meeting slated for July 10, with workers accusing the management of not providing an alternative date to sort out the stalemate. The union’s secretary general Albert Njeru said the hospital management had made fresh demands over the items in dispute. It is under the current circumstance that they have decided to lift the suspended strike notice, to commence on August 6, he said. “We issued the strike notice on May 19, 2017 on the non-payment but it was suspended after a conciliator was appointed by the Chief industrial relations officer, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection to conciliate the matter,” said Mr Njeru.
