At least 125 students have been arrested over the wave of unrest that has rocked schools across the country, Education CS Amina Mohamed has said. Ms Amina on Monday blamed the dorm fires and strikes on fear of exams and indiscipline. About 16 schools in Western and Nyanza regions have been closed in the last one week over student unrest. The top performing Maranda High School is among schools that have been hit by unrest in the past week. Others are Kisumu Girls, Ng'iya Girls, Ambira, Maliera, Onjiko, Otieno Oyoo, Chulaimbo, Oriwo, Ngere, Kandiege, Usenge, Barding, St Augustine Nyamonye, St Mary's Girls Mumias and Litein Boys High School. Arising from the incidents, the Education ministry said three students from Siakago Boys in Embu have been jailed for one year on probation and have since cleared from the school. Ms Mohamed said they can only attend a day school as they report to the local chief. But day schools have not been spared the unrest either after police yesterday arrested 15 students of Nyakeyo Secondary School in Marani, Kisii County, for allegedly torching two houses in Gekongo accusing villagers of "bewitching" a colleague who died on Saturday.
