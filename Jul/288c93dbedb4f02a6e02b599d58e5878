The Privatisation Commission is seeking a chief manager in charge of transactions as it moves to unlock the stalled sale of poorly performing State-owned firms. The commission was established in 2008 with the brief to sell 26 poorly performing parastatals to strategic investors and reduce their reliance on taxpayers. But the team led by former assistance minister Henry Obwocha has only managed to conclude a single deal over the decade. “Reporting to the chief executive officer, the chief manager transactions will be required to lead privatisation transactions in the commission,” said the Commission in a notice from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) — which is leading the executive search. In 2014, the Commission sold a 26 per cent stake in Kenya Wine Agencies Ltd (KWAL) to South Africa’s Distell Group Ltd, Africa’s largest producer of spirits, wines, ciders and ready-to-drinks. Mr Obwocha was recently quoted saying that due diligence on some firms, which he did not name had revealed that they don’t need to be privatised.

The parastatals the government approved for sale include National Bank of Kenya, Consolidated Bank of Kenya, Kenya Meat Commission, Development Bank of Kenya, East African Portland Cement, Kengen, Kenya Pipeline Corporation, Kenya Ports Authority, and five sugar millers: Chemilil, Sony, Nzoia, Miwani and Muhoroni. Others are Agrochemical and Food Corporation, New Kenya Co-operative Creameries, Numerical Machining Complex and Isolated Power stations, hotels (Kabarnet hotel, Mt Elgon Lodge Ltd, Golf Hotel Ltd, Sunset Hotel Ltd, Kenya Safari Lodges and Hotels Ltd).
