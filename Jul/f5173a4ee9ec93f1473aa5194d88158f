Coffee chain Java House has opened a new outlet in Diani, Kwale County, as it continues to expand its business across the country. The Sh50 million branch is located on the ground floor of the Centre Point building, formerly Nakumatt building. Java CEO Paul Smith said the new branch will cater to locals and international visitors in the tourist hub. "Today marks our 58th Java House store with our newest addition, Java House Diani being our 67th group store across all brands now in 14 cities," he said Tuesday. Mr Smith said the coffee chain will keep expanding as it creates more employment for the youth and empowers women, adding that at least 65 per cent of the firm's branch managers are women. Java House also comprises two other brands - Planet Yogurt and 360 Degrees Pizza - launched in 2011 and 2013 respectively.
