Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has suspended senior county officials over misuse of public funds, stepping up his fight against corruption amongst his staff. Sonko has requested Director of Criminal Investigations to carry further investigations, adding that those found guilty will be face the full force of the law. “I have this morning suspended several Nairobi County officials among them, Chief of Staff Brian Mugo, acting Chief Officer of Finance Ekaya Alumasi and acting Head of County Treasury, Stephen Mutua over misuse of public funds, pending investigations,” read a statement from the Governor’s office. In April, Sonko sent on forced leave 30 county procurement staff, over allegations of issuing inflated Local purchase Orders (LPOs), without his approval. The move comes barely a month after the governor suspended Devolution executive Vesca Kangogo for travelling to the United States, contrary to executive orders banning county executive members against going on foreign trips. The governor has also reshuffled his cabinet, swapping trade executive Allan Igambi and finance executive Newton Munene. ALSO READ: Sonko's action on Chandarana 'illegal'
