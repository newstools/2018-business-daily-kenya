Sugarcane farmers in western Kenya are optimistic the ailing milling companies will be rescued, following a two-day meeting of governors from the region. The National Federation of Sugarcane Farmers General Secretary Ezra Okoth said the governors should be given support by the national government to rescue the ailing sugar sector. “We are confident that the meeting that brought governors together will save ailing sugar companies,” said Mr Okoth. The meeting chaired by Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri was attended by governors Cornel Rasanga(Siaya), Wycliffe Wangamati (Bungoma), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Stephen Sang’ (Nandi). Also present were senators Moses Wetang’ula (Bungoma) and Ledama Ole Kina of Narok, as well as several MPs and agricultural executives of the sugar growing counties. The Nairobi meeting, coming in the wake of sugar dumping in the county, sought to, among other things, look into the status of state-owned sugar firms,and what ails the sector. The forums also scrutinised the Draft Sugar Regulations.
