Nairobi hosts the highest number of Kenya’s dangerous roads, a study by the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) shows. The study found that out of the 273 blackspots in Kenya where motorists are likely to get involved in accidents, over 70 or a quarter are in Nairobi NTSA chairman Jackson Waweru on Tuesday declared Riverside Drive junction, the JKIA-Airport turn off, and the Haile Selassie-Railway roundabout among the new blackspots. Others are the Landhies- Kamukunji roundabout on Landhies road, St Teresa junction in Eastleigh, Burma footbridge on Jogoo Road and Blue Post Bridge along Thika Super Highway. Speaking in Nairobi during the launch of the Northern Corridor and Nairobi County Route Hazard Mapping Report, Mr Waweru said the number of blackspots in Kenya had increased significantly from 166 five years ago. The number of people killed in road accidents across the country in 2017 however dropped compared to 2016. Nationally, there were 2,919 deaths recorded in 2017, a decrease of 1.6 per cent from 2016 when 2,965 were recorded. “Out of these, the Northern Corridor contributed 42.6 per cent,” he said.
