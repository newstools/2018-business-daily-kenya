Swiss President Alain Berset is set to be in the country starting Monday for a two-day official visit. State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said Wednesday the visit aims at strengthening bilateral ties between the two nations particular on the Big Four Agenda. President Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda aims to improve economic growth through spending, improving food security and rolling out universal healthcare, supporting manufacturing and building affordable housing. “The visit by the Swiss President is therefore intended to strengthen these close ties and identify other areas of cooperation particularly on the Big 4 agenda,” said Mr Esipisu. Mr Esipisu said during his visit, Swiss Development Agency in Arid and Semi-Arid Land (ASAL) areas are some of the issues that will be highlighted. Livestock and water sectors The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation is currently supporting the strengthening of Kenya’s livestock and water sectors in ASAL regions. “Their support is complementing government efforts at enabling robust and sustainable pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihoods in the region,’ he said. The government spokesman also said that President Kenyatta will also focus on migration and regional security in the seven-member Inter-Governmental Development Authority (IGAD) bloc which is leading efforts to restore peace and stability in South Sudan. “As a member state in IGAD, Kenya stands to benefit from a secure and prosperous continent and we therefore appreciate the financial, technical and operational investments currently being provided by the Swiss government,” he said.
