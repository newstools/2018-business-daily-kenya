MPs have opened investigations into the ownership status of a 10-acre prime land in Karen registered under the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF), but claimed by three other parties. NHIF, Wednesday told National Assembly’s Public Investments Committee (PIC) that it has been unable to secure the land two years after getting a court order to fence it off. Geoffrey Mwangi, the NHIF chief executive, said the former Commissioner of Lands ruled that the plot belongs to NHIF, but the National Land Commission (NLC) has refused to determine the owner on grounds that the property is subject to a court process. The land was valued at Sh298.6 million at the end of June 2016. “The land belongs to NHIF and we have a title deed for the same. However, Crown line Freighters were the initial claimants of the land but now we have Satex Kenya Limited and an individual by the name Peter David Parakwa,” Mr Mwangi said. The NHIF bought the land from Kaskasi Traders for Sh93 million in 2002.

The property was initially earmarked for construction of a resource centre but the plans were changed in favour of setting up a Sh1 billion medical centre. The committee resolved to invite former NHIF chief executive Richard Kerich and the then board members to shed light on the controversy. “It seems the CEO is frustrated by powerful individuals and unknown ghost forces,” Wajir East MP Rashid Amin said.
