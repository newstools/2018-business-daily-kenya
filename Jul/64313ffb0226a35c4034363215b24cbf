Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua has issued comprehensive guidelines to enable compliance of a presidential executive requiring all public entities to publish all awarded contracts. The move follows President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive through Executive Order No.2 of 2018 requiring all public entities -- comprising ministries, departments, counties and state corporations -- to publish all awarded contracts starting July 1. All public entities are expected to publish full details of all contracts awarded by them through a variety of means, including their websites, the e-Citizen portal, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority platforms, public notice boards and any other official government publications, as per the executive order The public entities are required to publish the report of the awarded contracts not later than the 15th day of the subsequent month without fail. Where the 15th day of the subsequent month falls on a weekend or public holiday, the agencies are required to publish the report on or before the day immediately before the weekend or public holiday in strict compliance with the 15-day rule. Coherence and uniformity The guidelines aim to foster coherence and uniformity in the reporting style and framework as well as bring to an end the opacity and relative secrecy that typified public procurement in the past. In line with Article 35 of the Constitution regarding Access to Information, Kenyans will now be able to easily access and interrogate information regarding specific details of public procurement including price and suppliers of goods and services. Further, the directive seeks to entrench transparency and accountability which are core considerations in President Kenyatta's fight against corruption, inefficiency and over-pricing of goods and services in public sector procurement. Kenyans have been encouraged to take advantage of the newly introduced framework that is characterised by the highest level of public scrutiny and accountability when doing business with public entities.
