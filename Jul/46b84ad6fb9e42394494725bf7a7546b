The National Building Inspectorate (NBI) has given a 14-day ultimatum to Kibera residents with illegal structures along a bypass set to connect Ngong road to Langata to vacate. The 4.2 kilometre four lane dual carriageway, also known as missing link 12 or the Ngong Road-Kibera-Kungu Karumba-Langata Link Road, has been under construction since 2016. In March 2016, however, residents of the slum filed two cases challenging the expected demolition of their homes and displacement. The case was thrown out towards the end of last year, thus paving way for construction of the road which cuts 60 metres wide from the DC’s office in the north to Kibera South Health centre, Langata and then to Kungu Karumba road. In a statement Wednesday, NBI’s chairman Moses Nyakiongora warned residents that failure to comply with the ultimatum would result in forcible eviction. “The construction of Ngong Road-Kibera-Kungu Karumba-Langata link Road is at an advanced stage. However, there are illegal structures which are on the said road reserve that have hindered the construction work at Kibera...This is therefore to give public notice that these structures must be removed before July 16. Upon the expiry of this notice, any structure or property found on the specified corridor will be demolished or removed from the road reserve at the trespassers’ risk and cost,” said Mr Nyakiongora. The Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) awarded a Sh2.1 billion contract for construction of the road to H Young &Company in 2016 . It will have 2.5-metre wide cycle tracks on each side, 2.5 metre-wide footpaths and piped drains on the outer kerbs.
