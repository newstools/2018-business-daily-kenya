China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), the Chinese company that operates the standard gauge rail (SGR), is set to be investigated over alleged mistreatment of local crew of the Madaraka Express train. Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) MD Atanas Maina on Monday said the firm will subject the managers to a thorough probe over alleged unethical labour practices against Kenyan workers and if found culpable, tough action will be taken against them in accordance with the law. “We have launched investigations into alleged incidents of mistreatment of local staff employed to facilitate operations at the standard gauge railway. “This is unethical conduct, if found to be authentic action will be taken in accordance with the contract between us and the operator and in accordance with the laws of Kenya,” said Mr Maina. CRBC, which in May issued its employees with gagging orders barring them from leaking any information about the firm’s activities signed a five-year operations, maintenance and service agreement with Kenya Railways for the Mombasa-Nairobi segment of the SGR line. The deal also requires the Chinese firm to maintain the equipment and rail tracks according to prescribed manuals and in line with best global industry standards. The Chinese operator has, however, on a number of occasions been accused of violating Kenyan workers’ rights. On Sunday, an investigation by a section of the media alleged that Chinese staff can never sit on the same table with Kenyans and locals are not expected to join their tables either. They are also not allowed to use Chinese vans during drop-off and pick-up times. CRBC has also been accused in the past of providing security to their Chinese counterparts on construction sites and leaving local employers at the mercy of wild animals.
