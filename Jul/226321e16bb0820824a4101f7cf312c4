About 8,000 foreign workers risk being deported after they failed to present themselves for the just concluded vetting of work permit holders. Immigration Permanent Secretary (PS) Gordon Kihalangwa said about 26,552 of the 43,550 holders of work permits had turned up at the Department of Immigration Services for verification of their details by the Saturday deadline. Mr Kihalangwa, who was speaking Monday at the Kenya School of Government, said the ministry will move with speed to deport foreigners who have been living and working in the country illegally. “We will not give foreigners jobs that can be done by locals. It’s an offence for employers to hire foreigners with illegal work permits, we must deport them,” he said. In May, the government started a 60-day operation to identify and deport illegal immigrants. During the crackdown, which came to a close two days ago, the immigration department created a digital register of legal foreign workers to provide them with electronic identification cards.

There is a variation (in numbers) from what we have in the data base,” said Mr Kihalangwa.
