The Architectural Association of Kenya (AAK) is pushing for members to be involved in building site inspection with state agencies to seal the enforcement gap. President Emma Miloyo said the government lacks the capacity to conduct meaningful audits in all construction sites. “Nairobi City County has about 15 enforcement officers and at any given time there are over 6,000 construction sites in Nairobi. With this number, they can’t cope,” she said at the recent launch of the status of Built Environment Report and the AAK annual convention. Last year, the National Buildings Inspectorate conducted a survey and found that more than 650 buildings were unfit for human occupation. In Nairobi, Huruma Estate topped the list of areas with dangerous buildings, with more than 388 such structures. Other city estates found with unsound buildings were Dagoretti (16), Baba Dogo (38), Umoja (18), Nairobi West (9), and South B (5). “The National Buildings Inspectorate, which has been mandated to audit these buildings has managed to vacate people from the buildings but some are going back to some of these condemned buildings,” said Ms Miloyo.
