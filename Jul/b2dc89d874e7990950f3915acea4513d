Former Kenya Power   managing director Ben Chumo on Monday told MPs that his net worth is Sh212 million. He made the revelation when he appeared before the National Assembly Finance Committee that vetted him for the position of Chairman of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). Dr Chumo, who is facing corruption charges at Kenya Power, said he has investments in businesses such as rental houses in Nairobi and farming in Eldoret. “My estimated net worth as we speak stands at about Sh212 million,” he told the committee chaired by Kipkelion East MP Joseph Limo. Dr Chumo, who has worked at Kenya Power for over 30 years, said he does not consider himself a rich man despite the immense wealth. “I can’t say I’m a rich man, in relative terms of course. I’ve not yet reached there. I can support my family. My four children; two of them are already out of the house, two are still in college,” he said. Last week, Dr Chumo was charged with abuse of office, conspiracy to commit economic crimes and failure to comply with procurement laws in the purchase of faulty transformers worth Sh450 million during his tenure at the helm of Kenya Power.
