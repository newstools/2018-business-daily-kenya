Nakuru County has recorded a 16.3 per cent growth in revenue collection despite depressed economic activities due to prolonged electioneering period last year. According to county records, the county collected Sh2.28 billion in the last financial year up from Sh1.96 billion collected in the 2016/17. Measures to seal revenue loopholes increased accountability and rotation of staff played a key role in revenue growth, according to Finance executive Joseph Kiuna. “Since coming into office, we have taken steps to break down the revenue budget into targets for each officer and each sub-county,” he said, adding that Nakuru plans to fully automate all its revenue streams. He said the growth means Nakuru qualifies for the additional two per cent allocation that the Commission on Revenue Allocation awards to counties that increase their internal revenues.

Governor Lee Kinyanjui has embarked on ambitious projects including an upgrade of infrastructure in Nakuru — one of the two key towns to be elevated to city status after the Ur­ban Ar­eas and Cities Amend­ment Bill got the Cab­i­net’s nod in September, paving the way for the cre­ation of two new cities in Kenya. Existing cities are Nairobi, Kisumu and Mom­basa. Eldoret is also set to become a city once the Parliament enacts the Bill. “The success of any county initiatives will depend on the capacity to raise revenue for its projects. The County seeks to reduce its dependence on National Treasury disbursements through the creation of a robust revenue base,” he said.
