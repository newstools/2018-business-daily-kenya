Senior State House official Stephen Kirogo has defended his age, saying he is fit to serve as chairperson of the Public Service Commission (PSC). MPs vetting him for the PSC position questioned his ability to adequately serve given that he has hit the mandatory retirement age of 60 years for the Civil Service. President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated Mr Kirogo for the position that fell vacant after Margaret Kobia was appointed cabinet secretary. He has been serving as the principal administrative secretary in the Cabinet Office. “Do not focus on my age, rather at the wealth of experience I bring on the table in this new role,” he told the National Assembly Committee on Administration and National Security. Mr Kirogo told MPs his net worth stands at Sh96.4 million, noting that if appointed to the position, he would deal with the matter of ethnicity in the Civil Service in a “definitive style” and improve productivity through “performance management”. If successful, he will replace Peter ole Nkuraiyia who has been acting since January. He will hold office for a non-renewable term of six years. Mr Kirogo emerged top from a list of candidates, including former Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) chairperson Sarah Serem, past chairman of the now defunct Transition Authority (TA) Kinuthia Wamwangi and previous Education PS George Godia. Other big names felled in the race that attracted 112 applicants were 2017 Bungoma governor aspirant Alfred Khangati and Laban Ayiro, who acted as Moi University vice-chancellor for more than a year. The selection panel shortlisted Mr Kirogo alongside former Egerton University vice-chancellor James Tuitoek and Njoki Kahiga, who briefly acted as the Public Service principal secretary in 2013 before she was nominated as a commissioner in the Kenya Law Review Commission for a five-year-term.
