Former assistant minister Danson Mungatana has landed a job with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa). Mr Mungatana (right) was on Wednesday sworn in as a Comesa Competition Commission board member at a summit in Lusaka following his nomination by the Kenyan government. Mr Mungatana joins a string of leaders from the Coast region who have been awarded jobs because of their loyalty to the Jubilee administration. Mr Mungatana came fourth in last year’s governor’s race for Tana River County and has since been job-hunting. The former Garsen MP applied for the Tana River County Assembly Speaker’s seat but later pulled out, handing opponent Justin Nkaduda an easy win. The veteran politician was later short-listed for the position of Clerk of the County Assembly but quit before the interviews. In October 2017, Mr Mungatana went job-hunting in Meru County where he was shortlisted for the position of Chief Legal Officer but failed to clinch the post.
