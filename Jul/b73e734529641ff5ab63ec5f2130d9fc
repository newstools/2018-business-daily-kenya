Authorities in Kwale County have moved to operationalise alcoblow gadgets in a bid to curb incidences of drunk driving at the tourist hub. County Police Commander, Tom Odero, said testing for drink driving was key to stemming roads accident caused by driving under the influence. "This is a preventative measure and not a punitive one. The officers are well trained and will be targeting drunk drivers," he said Friday. The gadgets can take photos, capture finger prints and detect amount of alcohol one has consumed. He said their use is meant to enhance safety on the roads especially along the county's busy highways. Rather than being stationed at specific points that drivers can evade, Mr Odero said traffic officers will administer the tests along with normal road operations. He also cautioned drivers against getting behind the wheel while drunk, saying they would not be spared irrespective of status. READ: NTSA acquires 50 more breathalysers despite ban
