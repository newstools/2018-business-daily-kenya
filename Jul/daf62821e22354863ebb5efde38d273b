The plan to compensate landowners along the Nairobi-Naivasha standard gauge railway route is now in motion, with surveyors and valuers being deployed to the ground. The Ministry of Lands, the National Lands Commission (NLC) and the Kenya Railways (KR) have deployed surveyors and valuers to various sites along Phase 2A of the route, to fast-track the land acquisition and compensation process, following President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s directive. A statement from Kenya Railways said the professionals will be on the ground for the next two weeks to aid awards and final payments to owners with proper documentation. On June 23, President Kenyatta inspected the SGR Phase 2A construction to assess the progress and deliberate on the best course of action, with key Cabinet secretaries involved in the project. He pinpointed key areas for improvement, to be addressed immediately. He directed land acquisition be fast-tracked and those affected compensated within a month to so that the contractor, China Road and Bridge Corporation is not hindered by unavailability of land.
