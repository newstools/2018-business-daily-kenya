Nairobi County residents will now be able to access all public toilets free of charge. Governor Mike Sonko issued the directive today even as the administration stands to lose Sh6.2 million in revenue from levies charged to use the facilities. "City residents should not be charged to use public toilets. It is unfair to charge voters of Nairobi to use a public facility...From today all toilets within the city will be free," said Governor Sonko. There are 68 public toilets in Nairobi with 17 of these in the CBD. In January last year, a city resident - Adrian Kamotho - petitioned the High court to order the county government to scrap charges on the use of public facilities. He had sued the Council of Governors, Kenya National Highway Authority and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority. Mr Sonko was speaking at Charter Hall Wednesday where he launched a Sh357 million bursary fund. Mr Sonko stated that the county government will increase the bursary funds annually by Sh500,000 in order to give equal opportunities for needy children to get education across the county.
