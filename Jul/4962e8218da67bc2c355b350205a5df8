Public Service and Youth Affairs secretary Margaret Kobia has stopped payments of pending bills amounting to Sh5.6 billion for supplies delivered to the National Youth Service (NYS) last year. The drastic move is part of the ongoing reforms and shake-up at the service riddled with claims of fraud amounting to Sh8 billion. NYS suppliers will also undergo fresh prequalification, Prof Kobia announced Wednesday, as the government moved to seal loopholes for pilferage of taxpayers’ money. Speaking when she unveiled the newly-appointed NYS acting director-general Matilda Sakwa, the CS further directed that all new payments be reviewed to determine their authenticity. “The ministry has undertaken in-depth assessment of NYS systems, policies, procedures and practices and is in the process of addressing each satisfactorily,” Prof Kobia said. “The nature of management at NYS requires a multi-pronged, impartial and sustained strategy. Remedial measures will include legal, policy, operational and administrative reforms.” President Uhuru Kenyatta has tapped Ms Sakwa, a career civil servant with 29 years of experience to lead reforms at the institution which is at the centre of investigations for fraud. Ms Sakwa, who has been the County Commissioner for Machakos, is tasked with reviewing the legal framework at the institution with a view to strengthening its corporate governance structure. She will also review the institutional framework to facilitate engagement with the 47 counties. Ms Sakwa will also lead automation, outsourcing and commercialisation of the institution for sustainability.
