The lowest paid dock workers will now earn Sh40,700 and the highest Sh97,000 after their union and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Some 5,300 staff are set to earn higher pay effective January 1 to enable them live more comfortably amid tough economic times. Dock Workers Union secretary general, Simon Sang, travelled to Nairobi for registration of the CBA. “We will be registering the CBA today. The lowest cadre of staff at Job group HG 4 will earn Sh40,700 from Sh37,710 with the highest worker earning Sh97,000 from Sh88,650 Job Group HG 1. Allowances increases between Sh1,000 and Sh2,000 across board,” he said Wednesday. He said workers at the port are protected under the International Labour Convection 137 which gives them salary protection. “We normally review after every two years, so the other one ended December 31, 2017 and this one will be effected from January 1 this year,” he said. On his part, Acting KPA managing director Daniel Manduku termed signing of the CBA a major milestone that will motivate port workers. “Transformation is a continuous process it’s not a stop gap. Changes are gradual but I have made strides in operational, trying to ensure that the targets, timeline and there is adequate allocation of personnel and equipment to perform certain tasks,” Dr Manduku said. “The workers have unique skills but they need to be motivated through adequate and relevant training. For now, I am understanding the metrics and operations at the port.” READ: Workers blame suspended KPA boss over port woes Job loss fears engulf port workers as purge looms Port workers say privatisation of terminal will lead to layoffs
