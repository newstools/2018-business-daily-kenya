The government has banned schools from borrowing from banks for development projects and paying suppliers. School principals are now required to get a letter from the Education ministry cabinet secretary and principal secretary to qualify for credit from banks and other financial institutions. According to Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang, public schools owe banks and other financial institutions millions of shillings. Dr Belio said the directive is aimed at curbing financial abuse and principals found flouting the ban will be sacked. The PS said school heads have over-borrowed, crippling school operations. “The government has banned schools from going to seek loans from banks for expansion of projects,” he said. Addressing parents, teachers and students at Our Lady of Victory Kapnyeberai Girls High School in Nandi County during the opening of a library, the PS said the directive must be obeyed. “Heads found breaking the rules will be dismissed from service since they must operate with funds which the government gives primary and secondary schools,” he said. Dr Belio directed county directors of education to stop school heads from seeking credit facilities from banks, adding that the ministry will not repay such loans. He said the ministry allocated over Sh6.5 billion for improving secondary schools last year alone. Dr Belio added that all public schools had received text books.
