Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has made it mandatory for county staff to wear name tags and use official languages when communicating in the new code of conduct aimed at promoting efficiency and accountability. The staff are required to speak in English or Swahili while in office in the new rules launched on Thursday. Mr Kahiga said the code of conduct signed by all the county staff would help improve service delivery. “All county public officers will be required to maintain and enhance public confidence and have minimum standards of behaviour to maintain the integrity of the office they hold,” said Mr Kahiga. The event was officially launched by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua who was also in the county for a two-day benchmarking event. “We are looking forward to fostering good relationship between the two counties that will see developments in various sectors,” Mr Mutua said. Mr Kahiga said the new set of rules would also create awareness on shared principles. He asked residents to shun divisive politics aimed at undermining development.
