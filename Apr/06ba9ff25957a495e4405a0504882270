Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has warned that climate change will cut acreage under maize crop by 40 per cent, setting the stage for lost earnings and food shortage in a growing population. Dr Wilson Rono, a crop scientist with FAO Kenya said temperatures are predicted to rise in coming years and will reduce the land under maize crop to 1.2 million hectares from the current 2 million. The forecast looks set to hurt farmers’ earnings, put pressure on inflation on the rising cost of the staple following scarcity besides leaving millions in need of food aid. “In the coming years production of maize is going to drop by 40 per cent as a result of hot temperatures that will not be conducive for the crop,” said Dr Rono, without giving timelines. Temperature rise has been occasioned by human activities such as destruction of forest and invasion of wet lands, leading to global warming.

Local scientists in collaboration with their international counterparts are developing a gene bank for indigenous crops such as millet and sorghum to come up with high yielding varieties for food sustainability in the country. According to researchers, these crops can withstand high temperatures and can perform well even with the effects of climate change. Kenya Agricultural Livestock and Research Organisation established a Genetic Resource Centre in 2013 and has currently stocked about 2,000 plant genes for future use.
