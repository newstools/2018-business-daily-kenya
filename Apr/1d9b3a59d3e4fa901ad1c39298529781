Farmers whose land have been earmarked for the establishment of a Sh200 billion coal fired power plant in Lamu have protested over delay in compensating them. The farmers on Thursday said the delay has created an opportunity for land gabbers who are eyeing their property. The landowners said they had received threats of eviction from grabbers who are now claiming ownership of their lands. The Lamu Coal plant project is being undertaken by the Amu Power Company, a consortium of Gulf Energy and Centum Investment. So far, 975 acres have already been set aside at Kwasasi area in Hindi Division for the establishment of the project expected to generate 1,050 megawatts upon completion.

But the farmers say despite the NLC’s intensive land surveys, identification and verification of the real owners to be compensated more than a year ago, not a single person has received compensation from the government.
