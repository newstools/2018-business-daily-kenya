Framers in Kirinyaga County will receive over a million fast-maturing and high-yielding macadamia seedlings in a project funded by Slovak Aid. The grafted seedlings mature in three as opposed to nine years for the non-grafted variety with higher yields of up to 50 kilogramme per year up from the 10 Kg on average that farmers get currently from their trees. Macadamia nut export and processing company Ten Senses Africa on Tuesday launched the first of four regional macadamia nurseries that will see propagation of seedlings availed to farmers. The move comes as a boost to the country at a time when production of macadamia nuts has remained low over the years despite high returns and demand for the crop locally and internationally. Speaking in Kirinyaga, Ten Senses managing director Frank Omondi said farmers stand to benefit from the initiative. “Demand in the global market is rising and outstrips supply. There lies an opportunity for Kenyan farmers to take advantage and be part of this global boom,” said Mr Omondi.

Slovak Ambassador to Kenya František Dlhopolek said the seedlings grant project is a major boon for macadamia farmers. “Kenya’s climatic condition is ideal for optimum macadamia production and the timing of this project to coincide with the rising global demand is not a coincidence- rather a calculated move to help local farmers prosper,” he said. Kenya is currently ranked fourth behind Australia, South Africa and the US in global production, but the proponents of this project anticipate that the initiative could propel the country to number one position. Earnings from macadamia nuts increased 19 per cent last year compared with 2016 on account of increased production and high demand.
