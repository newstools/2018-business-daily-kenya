A High Court judge on Monday denied signing documents alleged to have been used by a former magistrate to fraudulently transfer land worth Sh 2.3 billion belonging to a sugar miller in Kisumu County.Standing on a familiar territory, but on the opposite side of the court room, Justice Olga Sewe while testifying, told a Kisumu Court that her details were forged to authenticate court documents that facilitated the transfer of the land belonging to Miwani Sugar Company. “I am not the person who signed the document. It has several anomalies including printings (sic), which indicate that it was signed in 2000 and not 1993 as claimed,” said Justice Sewe. In the case, ex-magistrate Abdulkadir Elkindy has been charged alongside eight others with conspiracy to defraud the miller of its multibillion-shilling property, a crime it is alleged they committed between 2007 and 2008. The suspects have been charged with six counts with Mr Elkindy facing another charge of abuse of office where it is claimed he used his position as deputy registrar to issue a notification that an order had been issued for the sale of the property. The land was transferred to M/S Crosselly holdingsLimited company. More witnesses are expected to testify on July 17 and 18.
