Samsung Electronics is offering rewards to its Galaxy product consumers in a promotion dubbed “Score with Samsung.” Customers have a chance to win a 40-inch television for every purchase of a Samsung galaxy smartphone or tablet. “Our customers are at the heart of the growth of our business in the region. As we have continued to provide market leadership, we would like to demonstrate our appreciation to the consumers and give them a chance to acquire something more on top of the innovation and convenience of our devices,” said Charles Kimari, Head of Mobile Division at Samsung Electronics East Africa.
