Fares on the inter-county train service on standard gauge rail between Nairobi and Mombasa will be adjusted upwards next month. Kenya Railways managing director Atanas Maina said Friday the charges will be adjusted by about 30 per cent for economy class following approvals by the Transport ministry. The current fare for first class passengers on inter-county train, however, will remain untouched. “We will be adjusting our charges slightly on inter-county train service on the standard gauge rail train come May 1. The rates have finally been approved by the Transport ministry,” said Mr Maina. The inter-county service trains was launched last November.
