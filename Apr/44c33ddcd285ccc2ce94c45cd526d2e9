President Uhuru Kenyatta has made key parastatal appointments that saw terms of majority of board chairs renewed. In appointment via Gazette notice on Friday, Hannah Waitherero Muriithi, a former insurance manager and advocate of the High Court, has been picked to chair the National Hospital Insurance Fund for three years. Ms Muriithi, who was a senior manager at Gateway Insurance before setting up her own legal firm in 2009, replaces Mohamud Ali who resigned last year and successfully contested the governor’s seat in Marsabit. Mutea Iringo, the former powerful interior principal secretary who unsuccessfully run for the Imenti North parliamentary seat last year, makes a comeback to public limelight as the chair of the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB). He replaces Geoffrey King’angi, a former aide of retired president Mwai Kibaki, who is now the legislator for Mbeere South. NCPB – which procures, stores and maintains grain reserve stock on behalf of government – will also be key in helping realise the food security agenda in Mr Kenyatta’s legacy term. Former Machakos county assembly speaker Bernard Muteti Mung’ata has been appointed the chair of the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation (ICDC). The State-owned development financier and investor is expected to play a key role in setting up additional 1,000 small industries under the manufacturing pillar of the “Big Four” policy agenda. Mr Mung’ata replaces former secretary to the Cabinet Francis Kimemia, now the Nyandarua governor. Mr Kenyatta, at the same time, re-appointed James Ndegwa, Ngene Gituku, John Ngumi and Henry Obwocha to chair the boards of the Capital Markets Authority, Communications Authority of Kenya, Kenya Pipeline Corporation and Privatisation Commission, respectively, for another three years. All the appointments are effective from March 28.
