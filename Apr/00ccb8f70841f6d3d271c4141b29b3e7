Large businesses saved a total of Sh724 million in the past one year following their adoption of energy-efficient measures in line with the country’s quest to slash wastage. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) said that the savings were made by 67 companies, mostly factories which installed energy-efficient technologies and promoted conservation practices at their work places after conducting energy audits, which exposed sources of leakage and wastage. KAM disclosed its findings during the 14th edition of the annual Energy Management Awards last Friday. “Cumulatively, these (energy conservation) interventions have saved the industry close to Sh13 billion for the last 14 years,” Renewable Energy Principal Secretary Colleta Suda said during the gala. Edible oil manufacturer Bidco Africa was crowned the overall winner in the awards organised by KAM and the Ministry of Energy.

Manufacturing is one of the four main pillars identified by the government in its quest to lift the economy to a middle-income one, offering decent lifestyles and shared prosperity. The government has set a target of growing the industrialisation base from 10 per cent of the GDP to 15 per cent by 2022 through a raft of incentives including cheaper nighttime electricity tariffs.
