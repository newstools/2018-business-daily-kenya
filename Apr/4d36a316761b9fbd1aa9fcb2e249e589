Members of the County Assembly of Nakuru have started the process of impeaching the executive in charge of finance and economic planning, Joseph Kiuna. The MCAs are accusing the official of failing to submit numerous budget documents as set out in the Public Finance Management Act. Mr Kiuna is said to have failed to submit the annual development plan and the County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) which were due to be submitted at the Assembly by September 1. The County Fiscal Strategy Paper was also due by February 28 and county budget estimates by April 30. The 78-member House suspended its Wednesday afternoon session to discuss the delay of the documents as “a matter of county importance” as raised by the chairperson budget committee and Elementaita ward representative  Musa Ndung’u. Leader of Minority and Olkaria ward MCA Palanga Wanjala Manyonge initiated the process of impeaching the executive for gross misconduct and abuse of office by collecting signatures even as the debate was in progress. On Thursday, Mr Manyonge revealed that at least 55 MCAs had signed the petition to impeach the finance boss.

The MCAs said there was no time for public participation in the budget-making process with only 19 days remaining. Mr Ndung’u said the executive was approved by the assembly after promising to efficiently deliver services to the residents. But since he was appointed, everything has come to a standstill, he said. “Many projects have stalled since the regime took over and the budget process is now in total confusion,” said Mr Ndung’u. Biashara Ward rep in Naivasha, Mr Joel Karuti Maina public said the Finance executive was holding the county hostage by refusing to perform his duties.
