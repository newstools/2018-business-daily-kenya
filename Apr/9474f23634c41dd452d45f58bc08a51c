The Senate is planning to take its sittings from the assembly hall in Nairobi to the counties. Senate speaker Kenneth Lusaka said the move is expected from August. He said this will give lawmakers an opportunity to make follow ups on the monies allocated to counties and enable them engage with the electorates more. “In August we shall hold our first sitting outside Nairobi in Uasin Gishu County,” said Mr Lusaka. Speaking in Kakamega town in the sidelines of the ongoing devolution conference, Mr Lusaka said senators were eager to establish a good working relationship with governors so that the oversight role is not seen as witch-hunt. “The first term of five years in office under devolution was a learning process and senators ended up colliding with governors because they had not understood their roles,” said the former Bungoma governor. Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya said the roles misunderstanding was partially to blame for delayed funding to counties in the first assembly. “ Counties were getting delayed funds from the national government because senators didn’t play their roles right,” he said.\ “The oversight role means overseeing actual transfer of funds from the national government.”
