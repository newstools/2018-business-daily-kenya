Industrial gas manufacturer BOC Gases   has begun the hunt for a new head a month after its outgoing managing director gave notice to quit. BOC Gases managing director Millicent Onyonyi announced her resignation mid-February, two years after she took helm at the firm, which has seen a downturn in sales due to competition from imports. She is set to vacate office at the end of this month. Hawkins Associates will assist in the search for the new chief. “Our client BOC Kenya Limited…is seeking to fill the position of managing director who will ensure that the company continues to grow and develop in line with the strategic plan through reviewing, developing and implementing appropriate strategies and policies,” said Hawkins Associates in a notice posted in dailies. “Applicants should hold a Masters Degree in Business Administration, Engineering, Commerce or Finance with over 10 years senior management experience preferably in manufacturing sector,” added the firm. READ: BOC boss exits as business struggles with declining sales Ms Onyonyi, who is also the former Oil Libya retail coordinator, was appointed in April 2016, replacing Ms Maria Msiska who had left the firm in January of that year after five-and-a-half years at the helm. She has led the firm through increasingly lean times, as its sales came under pressure due to competition from oxygen and nitrogen imports. The firm issued a profit warning last November, saying its net profit for the financial year ending December 2017.
