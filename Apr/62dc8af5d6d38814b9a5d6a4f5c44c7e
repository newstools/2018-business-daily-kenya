Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi says the Sh40 million sweet potato processing plant in Maua that has been in operation for two months will be expanded to cushion farmers from losses linked to its limited capacity. He did not say when the upgrade will be done, but indicated that the county government will also facilitate setting up of a substation at a cost of Sh600 million to alleviate power shortages in the town and ensure stable supply to the plant. The Sh40 million project, supported by the European Union through the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) and the county government, is owned by more than 800 sweet potato farmers under the Friends Sacco. It opened its doors two months ago and bakes 700 loaves of bread daily from 100 kilos of sweet potatoes each day. However, farmers are left with a further 100 kilos of sweet potatoes without market.

The county will support its expansion and marketing of the various products being manufactured here,” Mr Murungi said last Thursday during the official launch of the factory. “We will also work with concerned government agencies and ensure that the power station is in place,” he added. Friends Sacco chairman Mbae Imanene said there were immediate plans to invest Sh5 million to buy more processing equipment and increase baking capacity to about 900 loaves daily.
