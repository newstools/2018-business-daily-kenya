The fight against female genital mutilation (FGM) in Samburu and Marsabit counties got a boost Thursday after Amref and USAID launched a Sh372.5 million project meant to curb the practice. The three-year project dubbed Koota Injena (come let us talk) will involve training the Rendille, Borana, Gabra and Samburu communities on the dangers of FGM. It will also help in conducting rescue efforts for girls about to undergo the cut. The training and rescue efforts will be carried out by clan elders with support from Amref and USAID. By working closely with clan elders, the stakeholders aim to make headway in dealing with other outdated practices such as child and forced marriages in the two counties. Berdenette Lolojuu, Anti-FGM Board chief executive officer said “collective energy and collaborations” are needed in the fight against female cut while stating that such efforts were stating to yield positive results. “Our efforts to curb the practice of FGM among the Maasai and Samburu communities are beginning to bear fruits. We are starting to see an increase in the number of anti-FGM male activists. I am glad that our effort to stop this backward culture is beginning to bear fruits,” said Ms Lolojuu.
