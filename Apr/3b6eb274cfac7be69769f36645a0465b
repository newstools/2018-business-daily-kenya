The Kenya Railways (KR) on Friday got a boost after another shipping line committed to transport cargo from Mombasa Port to the Inland Container Deport (ICD) in Nairobi through the standard gauge railway (SGR). PIL (Kenya) Ltd on Friday flagged off a full block of freight trains to Nairobi after signing an agreement with KR at the port. The signing of the agreement and the commencement of transportation of cargo by the shipping line is expected to boost SGR freight services. The train loaded with 180 containers left Mombasa Port at 4pm for ICD in Nairobi.
