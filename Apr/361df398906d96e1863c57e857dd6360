Meteorological department has said most parts of the country will continue receiving moderate rainfall with only the North Eastern region expected to experience increased precipitation for the next five days. Kenya Meteorological Services director Peter Ambenje said that wet conditions will continue over several parts of the country with several areas within the Central Highlands, the Coast and the South East Lowlands likely to continue receiving light to moderate rainfall. He, however, stated that some parts of the North Eastern may experience enhanced rainfall at the beginning of the forecast period, which is from today till Monday next week. “We are basically expecting wet conditions and nothing significant apart from the North Eastern where we are expecting significant rainfall between today and tomorrow while the rest will just have light to moderate rainfall and not the one we have been getting that cause flooding,” said Mr Ambenje on Tuesday. For the past two weeks most parts of the country continued to experience reduced rainfall although a few areas in the North, the Central Highlands and the Coast recorded enhanced rainfall amounts. Mr Ambenje added that the peak of rainfall in most areas in the country is in April as the long rains season covers March, April and May with its cessation depending on specific regions in the country. He said the moderate rainfall expected is good for farming and advised Kenyans to wear warm clothes as the week will likely have cloudy mornings breaking into light rains before giving way to sunny intervals with showers in the evening. “Over most parts of the country April is the peak apart from the Coast where May is the peak.” “The forecast for April shows that we might see some good rainfall during the month. The cessation then depends on the region like in the Western parts there is no cessation as such,” he said.
