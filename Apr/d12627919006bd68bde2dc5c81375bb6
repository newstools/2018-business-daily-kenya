Safaricom Kenya is carrying out a system maintenance that will leave customers unable to access some of its services during the period. The maintenance affects purchase of data bundles, Flex plans, SIM Swap service, product purchases and Okoa Jahazi starting Saturday noon to Sunday 2pm. All USSD services, top ups, balance enquiries, data bundle purchases, Tunukiwa service, outgoing international voice and SMS will also be unavailable from Saturday night (10pm) to Sunday. Safaricom Director of Strategy and Innovation Joseph Ogutu said in a statement all other services including voice, data and M-Pesa will remain available. Security measures The system upgrade follows a raft of measures to boost security and efficiency that Safaricom started implementing last year. The M-Pesa upgrade which started in July last year, has seen new features added to the platform and some functions automated, reducing the need for customers to make request at its call centre. The system upgrade also reduced the time that new partners take to be integrated onto the M-Pesa system.
