Governors want conditional grants and donor cash for different development projects factored in the Division of Revenue Bill 2018, which the National Assembly has passed. Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok said they have reviewed the Division of Revenue Bill and made recommendations to the Senate to include grants worth Sh1.5 billion from the Global Fund. Grants from the fund, which exclusively finance malaria, HIV and tuberculosis programmes — pass through the national government, which acts as the principal recipient. The Ministry of Health then determines how the money is allocated to the devolved units, which are the primary implementers of the Global Fund programmes. Additionally, the Bill has itemised the conditional allocations to fund the leasing of medical equipment, which increased from Sh4 billion to Sh9 billion but governors yesterday protested saying they were not privy to any agreements on the same, according to Mr Nanok. READ: Governors seek law review to protect deals with Treasury The Division of Revenue Bill is the annual law passed by Parliament to divide money raised by the Treasury between national and county governments — a constitutional obligation under Article 218 of the supreme law. The Bill is in the Senate and is on track to be approved by Parliament before the end of the current financial year. Mr Nanok, who is also the Turkana Governor, said Sh1.8 billion from the Agricultural Sector Development Programme II is also not provided for in the Bill. The governors urged the Senate to further reject the Division of Revenue Bill over failure to raise the allocation from 15 to 19 per cent of the Road Maintenance Fuel Levy Fund. According to the Bill, devolved units will receive Sh8.3 billion, which is 15 per cent of the levy fund.
