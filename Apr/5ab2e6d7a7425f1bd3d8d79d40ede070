The National Land Commission has issued title deeds to 2,070 out of 27,000 public schools in the country. Abigael Mbagaya Mukolwe, the NLC vice chairperson, told Parliament that the commission needs money to fast-track the issuance of titles to safeguard land belonging to schools. She said the commission has faced challenges in the issuance of the documents to schools, including lack of parcel numbers given that most education officers at the county level do not know the plot numbers. “The commission has, however, developed tools for collecting school information in consultation with county governments and education officers,” Ms Mukolwe said. She said 2,070 schools have been issued with title deeds. “In settlement areas the land is allocated to schools as individuals. The ministry is doing discharges of most of the 27,000 schools. A number of them have been cleared for tilting and we are negotiating with the ministry,” she said.
