Coffee farmers have received a major boost after the Baringo county government signed a Sh100 million deal with the World Best Friend, a Korean-based NGO for the construction of a milling plant. The project will also have a coffee processing and packaging plant in the county complete with a business information centre that will support marketing of coffee products in the global market. Baringo County Governor Stanley Kiptis said his administration is committed to expanding production of coffee to satisfy the local and export market. “We are ready to produce enough coffee required for the sustainable operation of this mill, to meet the needs of Korea and other markets because we have the potential,” said Mr Kiptis. The governor said he has asked for a further Sh100 million from the national government to assist Baringo farmers produce quality coffee. A Korean coffee investor, Cha Bo Yong said they are ready to purchase Baringo Coffee at attractive prices and export the products to Korea once they have been milled. The Korean investors have also offered to put up solar energy plant at the county referral hospital in Kabarnet and at Kabarnet High School, to supplement power demands as well as reduce the cost of electricity bills incurred by the two institutions. This was announced by Solar energy investor Jang Taek Jin of Samho Corporation who added that the world is going for green energy due to challenges of erratic weather and climate change.
