Importers have protested at Kenya Revenue Authority and the anti-graft agency's failure to act on an official arrested last year for soliciting Sh800,000 to clear containers. Instead, they said, the official has been transferred to a more "sensitive" department with high interaction with customers. A letter by the KRA Southern regional co-ordinator Nicholas Kinoti seen by the Business Daily indicated the official had been transferred from Trade Facilitation Unit to Pre-Verification Office. “This is to inform you that you have been redeployed from Trade Facilitation Unit to Pre-Verification Office (PvoC) Forodha House with immediate effect,” the letter dated March 27, states. Not taken to court On Monday, the importers, led by Mr Ismail Abdalla, questioned why the official had not been taken to court claiming he was being protected by some influential personalities. “The official should at least have been suspended or taken to court or be taken to a less risky area. We don’t know why the investigations are dragging on,” Mr Abdalla said. Another importer who sought anonymity accused the official of highhandedness and demanding Sh100,000 from each container to be cleared. A KRA official, who asked not to be named as he is not allowed to speak to the media, said the bribery claims were still under investigations and that action would be taken once completed. Two weeks The official is said to be reporting to EACC office after every two weeks as the organisation awaits consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions to charge him. On December 11, detectives from the anti-corruption watchdog arrested the senior KRA official in Mombasa. The officers pounced on the tax official after laying a trap for him in his office.
