For millennials, it is mostly about having the best things in life. Flying first class to exotic destinations to sample the very best, drinking fine champagne or whisky, going to exclusive clubs and shopping in designer shops; these are experiences that set them apart from the rest. The young generation is growing up with a fine taste in clothes, watches, cars, liquor and houses. And they don’t shy away from spending.
