A Sh2.1 billion project by UN habitat and the national government to relocate Ngong dumping site faces resistance from a section of residents in Kajiado County. The residents are opposing relocation of the mega Ngong dumping site, currently occupying five acres,  to a  20-acre location near their homes saying it’s a health hazard. The project is funded by UN habitat, the national government and the county government with the later providing land. Initial plans for the project have been undertaken for the last four months with a team of environmentalists finalising their studies. Integrated waste management system will be applied in the proposed dumpsite.
