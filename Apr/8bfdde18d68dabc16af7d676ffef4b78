Nigerian billionaire Tony Elumelu has asked Kenyan entrepreneurs to practise patience in their entrepreneurial journey to reap its full benefits. Mr Elumelu spoke during an interactive session at the University of Nairobi, where he encouraged students to focus on the long-term vision as opposed to dwelling on short-term challenges. “Think big, but beyond that, act on the ideas and think long-term. The journey would not be smooth but perseverance is key,” said Mr Elumelu who is United Bank of Africa (UBA) chairman. The key message during the session was that Africans should embrace technology and be faithful in transforming the continent through businesses that help end unemployment. Mr Elumelu founded the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) in 2010 to spur African economic growth through empowering entrepreneurship. He committed a $100 million (Sh10 billion) to sponsor 10,000 African entrepreneurs over 10 years.

Kenya ranked third in the number of entrepreneurs selected for the fourth edition of the TEF Entrepreneurship Programme, after Nigeria and Uganda.
