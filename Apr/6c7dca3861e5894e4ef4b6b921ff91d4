The number of students selected to join universities this year has dropped by nearly a third, lowering the burden on the institutions and the Higher Education Loans Board. The government yesterday said some 62,851 out of the 69,151 candidates who scored C+  of 46 points and above in the 2017 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams have been selected to join universities under the government sponsored programme. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed announced that 36,945 of those selected are male while 25,946 are female. The number is lower compared to the 88,923 candidates who attained C+ in 2016 and were selected to join universities, including in private institutions, under the taxpayer funded scheme. During last year’s exam, 70,073 scored C+ and above, the minimum grade for university admission. Of these, 553 opted for diploma courses, according to the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS). Further, 5,747 representing 8.3 per cent who scored C+ and above did not secure placement. Of these, 2,128 did not apply while 3,619 applied but could not competitively secure placement. “I call upon the placement service to reach out to these candidates individually to give them a chance to apply,” said Ms Mohamed. She said that the government is determined to ensure that no qualified student is denied a chance to join local universities. “I expect a report of the unplaced students within two weeks,” she said Ms Mohamed said those who have secured courses but wish to transfer to other programmes will be given a one month window to explore alternative options. She said that the number of students selected to pursue courses in science technology and mathematics (STEM) increased by 20 per cent compared to the previous year. She said that 28,135 of the candidates, 44.76 per cent, were admitted to science courses while 34,716 will study humanities. Of the group joining STEM programmes, 8, 979 are female while 19, 156 are male. The CS said the ministry is keen on increasing admission to STEM courses and to addressing gender imbalance.
