Power token firm Professional Digital Systems Ltd (PDSL), has defended its contract with Kenya Power   and dismissed claims that it overcharges consumers even as Parliament prepares to investigate its relations with the listed monopoly. PDSL, which runs the VendIT brand, a utility vending platform and a payment gateway, says it was hired in an open tender and bills consumers under the guidelines issued by Kenya Power. “When a Kenya Power customer vends, an equivalent amount is deducted and credited to Kenya Power and the customer receives either a token or a credit to his post-paid account with a similar amount,” said the firm’s general manager for marketing and communications Pauline Kahiga. “VendIT does not levy any other charge to its customers apart from the monthly commission paid by Kenya Power as per its contract,” she said. READ: New entrants seek to end Kenya Power’s retail market monopoly VendIT has been in the eye of a storm after a number of pre-paid consumers complained of slow or non-responsive token generation from Kenya Power’s own M-Pesa paybill and accused the utility firm of pushing them to third party vendors. Kenya Power has linked the slow service to high traffic that has seen 160,000 or 85 per cent of daily prepaid token being purchased on M-Pesa service. Critics have accused the firm of jamming its system to force consumers to shift to third party vendors.
