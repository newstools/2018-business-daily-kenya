It is a sigh of relief for former and current top Kenyan international runners living in Uasin Gishu after local MCAs unanimously passed a Motion that will exempt them from paying parking fees in Eldoret town as a sign of appreciation for bringing glory to the country. The mover of the Motion, Cheptiret-Kipchamo MCA Gilbert Tenai said the move was necessary due to the constant harassment of the sportsmen by county enforcement officers when they park their vehicles in the town streets. He said the athletes market the country globally that the only way to appreciate their good work is to exempt them from paying parking fees. “The Motion has been passed by all county assembly members and it is only waiting to be signed into law by the executive for its implementation,” said Mr Tenai. He said cases, where private vehicles belonging to the runners were being clamped down by county enforcement officers for none payment of parking fees, will now be a thing of the past once the Bill is assented to into law. Eldoret is home to top athletes among them former World steeplechase record holder Ezekiel Kemboi, Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge, women’s New York City Marathon winner Mary Keitany and Berlin Marathon winner Gladys Cherono. If implemented, Uasin Gishu will be the first county to spare athletes from paying parking fees. Mr Tenai spoke at the unveiling of a filling petrol station owned by international marathoner Vivian Cheruiyot at Annex trading centre on Eldoret-Nakuru highway. Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago, Senator Margaret Kamar, Kesses MP Swarup Mishra, his Ainabkoi counterpart William Chepkut, Elgeyo Marakwet women rep Jane Chebaibai and Athletics Kenya president Jack Tuwei, among other dignitaries attended the function. Mr Mandago assured hundreds of the runners who also graced the event that he would sign into law the bill once it lands on his desk.
