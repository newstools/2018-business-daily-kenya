The Rural Electrification Authority (REA) on Wednesday announced changes in its management structure with the appointment of three senior managers to back up Peter Mbugua, who was named the agency’s chief executive a few months ago. Mr Simon Gicharu, who chairs the agency’s board said the changes were informed by a recent systems audit that revealed weaknesses in the organisation’s structures and low staff capacity. Mr Gicharu on Wednesday said the changes had consequently been made purely on the basis of qualifications, experience and gender balance. The new appointees include Esther Ruto who has been picked to head technical services), Rose Mkalama (directorate of corporate services), while David Gitonga takes charge of the directorate of research, strategy and planning). Other managers have also been appointed to head the ICT, legal, internal audit, finance and administration, business development and procurement departments. “With this strong management team, we are sure that REA will deliver on its mandate and deliver on some of its key projects such as the Garissa 54.5MV project, which is the biggest of its kind in East and Central Africa; the mini-grids and others,” said Mr Gicharu. \He said the Garissa solar project, which cost Sh13.5 billion, is 70 per cent complete and REA expects it to be finalised by September. Last year, Rose Mkalama (then company secretary), Joan Riitho (audit manager), Elizabeth Onoka (human resource) and procurement manager Wilfred Oduor were ordered to step aside to pave way for investigations.
