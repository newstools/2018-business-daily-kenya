Kenya Railways has urged importers with less than 10 containers to team up and form a block to be able to use the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) freight services. The rail firm's business, commercial and operations team leader James Siele said they are ready to work with and accommodate the small-scale container importers. “The people who have one or two containers will be accommodated in the other [older metre-gauge] trains, but if they are able to come together and build the blocks, we are willing to give them block trains as and when they require,” he said. Mr Siele said using the SGR will improve customer satisfaction as it will reduce waiting time at the Nairobi's Inland Container Depot (ICD).

On Friday, the Kenya Railways signed an agreement with the global shipping line, aimed at boosting the number of containers being ferried via SGR. Mr Siele termed the agreement a boost to the Kenyan economy and a continuation of the State corporation’s undertaking to promote the Nairobi ICD.“With another shipping line committing to use SGR, we are optimistic that the number of containers being ferried via the railway will increase, this will in turn have a positive impact on the country’s economy,” he said.
