Traders at the Gakoromone market in Meru town will have to enroll with the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) before they are allowed to trade in the facility, Governor Kiraitu Murungi has said. The governor said anybody without the NHIF card would not be allowed to sell their produce at the facility. “I have realised that most of you have not registered with the health fund and this is serious. We don’t want to play around with health matters because you will do business here thinking you are making money but the moment you fall sick all that money will go in one day,” he said. The governor spoke on Wednesday when he launched a clean-up campaign targeting all the main towns in the county. He also announced plans to refurbish and modernise the market. He said his government would allocate enough funds to install electricity, supply water, pave the grounds and expand the facility. “This market is very dirty and we cannot allow traders to continue operating in this environment. It is unbelievable that we buy our food from a place that is so filth,” he said.
