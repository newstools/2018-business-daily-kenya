Drama ensued Monday morning after goons stormed and cut short a press conference called by former Nairobi Central Business District Association (NCBDA) chairman Timothy Muriuki. Mr Muriuki had called the press conference to update the media on some of the measures that needs to be undertaken to restore Nairobi city’s lost glory, at Boulevard Hotel. But immediately before he could start addressing the media, heavily built men intercepted him forcing him to cut short his speech. The attackers, who thought that Mr Muriuki was out to put to task Governor Mike Sonko for the sorry state of the city, then tore his press statement into pieces. They then led him out of the hotel by force as Mr Muriuki tried to plead with them that they should let him finish reading his statement and hear what he had to say. 'Unacceptable' “This is unacceptable. I’m going to record a statement at Central Police station after which I will brief you on the way forward. "Read my statement -- it's actually supporting Governor Mike Sonko,” said Mr Muriuki in a telephone interview with the Business Daily. In the statement, Mr Muriuki is calling upon city residents to stop piling pressure and blame games on the governor for the sorry state of the city. “There are a number of institutions that need to come together and work in concert to deliver the desirable Nairobi we all want. "Spending all our time and energy piling blame on Governor Sonko alone is escapist and diversionary,” says Mr Muriuki.     Criticism Mr Sonko has been under criticism by city residents in the recent past over the failure to clean up the rot in the city. On Sunday, he promised to get rid of boda boda riders and street families from the city, terming them an eyesore.
