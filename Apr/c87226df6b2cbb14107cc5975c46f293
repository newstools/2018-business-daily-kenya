Governor Amason Kingi has suffered a setback after the county assembly passed a motion revoking the appointment of five chief officers he had reappointed. The motion tabled by Watamu ward MCA George Baya said the governor had appointed the five chief officers without vetting and approval by the County Assembly as required by law. The chief officers are Kenneth Kazungu (Roads), Adan Mohamed (Devolution), Joseph Nguzo (Lands), Patience Tsimba (Trade) and Kombe Ngari ( Water). While tabling the motion, the MCA quoted Section 4 of the Public Appointments (County Assemblies Approval) Act 2017 that says any appointment needs to be approved by the County Assembly. “The chief officers were subjected to the interview and we were waiting the names to be brought to the assembly but the executive skipped the procedure that is why we are here today,” said Mr Baya. Kakuyuni MCA Nickson Mramba accused the governor of being a dictator by skipping the assembly in his appointment. “The list was brought to the County Assembly clerk through email but again another email came in asking the clerk to revert the names, and that is when the chief officers were illegally reappointed by the governor,” he added. Jaribuni MCA Maitha Masha who chairs the implementation committee said they would ensure the assembly is respected. “In the event that the governor refuses to recall the chief officers as the assembly has directed, we shall use legal ways to drive them out of office,” he said.
