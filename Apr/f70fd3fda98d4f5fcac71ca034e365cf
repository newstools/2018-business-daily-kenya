Embattled electoral agency chairman Wafula Chebukati and two other commissioners failed to appear before Parliament on Wednesday even as Minority Leader John Mbadi called for the prosecution of all commissioners. Mr Chebukati, and commissioners Abdi Guliye and Boya Molu were to appear before the National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs committee over the crisis that followed the suspension of Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chief executive Ezra Chiloba and the resignation of three commissioners on Monday. The three remaining commissioners were also expected to meet with the committee over electoral laws review in time for the 2022 General Election. Mr Chebukati wrote to the committee seeking adjournment of the meeting, citing their participation in two by-elections for members of the county assemblies. “The commission writes and regrets that it is unable to honour the invitation as it is today engaged in two by-elections in Ruguru and Kinondo county assembly wards.

We kindly request that you reschedule today’s sitting to a later date,” Mr Chebukati wrote to the committee chaired by Baringo North MP William Cheptumo. Mr Mbadi said that before the remaining three commissioners are pushed out of office the country must decide on how to undertake an overhaul of the commission and the secretariat.
