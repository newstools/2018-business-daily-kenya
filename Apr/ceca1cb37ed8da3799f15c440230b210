Kenya Reinsurance Corporation   Ltd will not be able to commence the process of replacing sacked managing director Jadiah Mwarania. Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge Byram Ongaya on Tuesday, extended the orders restraining Kenya Re from appointing another person to replace him. Mr Mwarania, through lawyer Judith Guserwa, claims that attempts to remove the board chairman and two directors are what cost him his job. The CEO’s exit was announced through a Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)  notice, which indicated that Michael Mbeshi, the reinsurer’s property management general manager, would take over as acting managing director. The notice was signed by board chairman David Kemei. He says his woes started the moment he received a letter from Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua directing him to commence the removal of Mr Kemei and board members Maina Mukoma and Chiboli Shakaba.

Lawyer Guserwa requested the court to determine the case before Kenya Re holds its annual general meeting (AGM) on June 16, 2018.Mr Mwarania has served the Corporation for over 20 years, and rose through the ranks to managing director. Kenya Re has been given two weeks to file a response. The case will be heard on May 17, 2018.
