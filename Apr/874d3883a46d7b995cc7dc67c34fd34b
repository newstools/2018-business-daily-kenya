Fourteen county governments from the lake region have until end of June to pass the resolutions of a summit to form an economic alliance.Under the Lake Region Economic Bloc (LREB), chairman Wycliffe Oparanya indicated that the counties will be bound by the accord as soon as a third of the assemblies pass the Bills. Mr Oparanya last week expressed confidence during a tour of the Kisumu secretariat that the alliance will strengthen economic and social growth of the region. “This means that it will only take five counties for us to jumpstart the regional integration which is expected to leverage on economies of scale and use shared resources such as Lake Victoria and other natural resources,” he said. The population of the bloc covering Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori, Kakamega, Bungoma, Busia, Vihiga, Trans Nzoia, Kisii, Nyamira, Bomet, Kisumu, Nandi and Kericho is estimated at 14 million people.

Every county is expected to contribute Sh200 million by end of October towards attaining the Sh1 billion share capital of the bank. “We will start negotiations with any bank that we shall have identified as soon as we hit the Sh1 billion mark,” he told the press. Kakamega County has banked part of the share while Kisumu has deposited Sh100 million at the special purpose bank created at the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). “The member counties will be encouraged to use the new financial institution as a way of spurring economic growth,” he said. Acting CEO Abala Wanga said they will recruit to work on the structure of the alliance.
