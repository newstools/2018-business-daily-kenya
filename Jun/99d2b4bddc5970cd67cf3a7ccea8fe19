Governor Mike Sonko on Tuesday suffered a major setback after the county assembly rejected lawyer Miguna Miguna as deputy governor nominee. Speaker Beatrice Elachi said the assembly could not debate the name of the lawyer as he is a dual citizen contrary to provisions of article 78 of the Constitution, which provides that a person is not eligible for election or appointment for a state office unless the person is a citizen of Kenya. “From the foregoing, I therefore wish to direct that pursuant to provisions of Standing Order number one of the assembly, the name of the nominee for the position of the deputy governor be referred back to the appointing authority for further validation,” she said. Ms Elachi was responding to a question from minority chief whip Peter Imwatok who sought the chair’s direction on the status of Mr Miguna’s nomination. The speaker said the nominee did not furnish the assembly’s Vetting and Appointments Committee with relevant documents to enable his vetting. “It has been a hard task trying to find Miguna’s documents yet we need to forward them to the various institutions for verification. “However, our legal team is trying to see how were going to go through with it,” she said.
