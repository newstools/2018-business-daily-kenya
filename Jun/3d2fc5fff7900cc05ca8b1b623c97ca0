At least 109 Tanzanian fishermen were on Saturday arrested by the Kenya Navy for engaging in illegal fishing within Kenya's territorial waters in Shimoni. Speaking to the Business Daily by phone on Wednesday, Lunga Lunga Deputy County Commissioner Josphat Biwott said the fishermen were apprehended after they were found violating territorial limits of the country. "The fishermen were arrested for their alleged indulgence in illegal fishing inside the Kenya's territorial waters," he said. Mr Biwott said the 109 fishermen were remanded for failing to raise a cash bail of Sh20,000 each after appearing before a Kwale Court on Monday. Area MP Khatib Mwashetani has appealed to the government to secure their release, saying the country enjoys a mutual relationship with Tanzania. Diplomatic row Speaking at Kwale Baraza Park during the World Environment Day celebrations, Mr Mwashetani asked Deputy President William Ruto to take action to avoid a diplomatic row between the two countries. "Those who were arrested are our brothers and we share a lot in common because most of the people living in Shimoni depend on fishing for their livelihood," he said, adding that if they are not going to be released then the relationship between the two countries will deteriorate. Mr Mwashetani added that most of those arrested are fishermen from Pemba Island, some of whom are living in the country. In the past, Kenyan fishermen have accused foreign nations of engaging in illegal fishing using big vessels along the coastline.
