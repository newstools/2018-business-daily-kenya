Land owners along the standard gauge rail (SGR) running from Nairobi to Narok are set to earn millions of shillings in compensation in the next two weeks in the race to complete the Sh150 billion line by June next year. “The Ministry of Lands, National Lands Commission, and Kenya Railways have deployed land surveyors and valuers to various sites along the route to fast track the land acquisition and compensation process. The professionals will be on the ground for the next two weeks to facilitate awards and final payments to owners with official documents,” said Kenya Railways managing director Atanas Maina. The line will link the planned Naivasha export processing zone and Ol Karia geothermal fields to the Sh327 billion Nairobi-Mombasa railway. The contractor, China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC ), moved to the site last October and has since been working despite numerous challenges. President Uhuru Kenyatta has challenged the contractor to stick to the June 2019 completion timeline. The fast passenger rail service will see Kitengela, Ngong, Ongata Rongai in Kajiado County, Kamangu in Kiambu, Suswa in Narok and Mai Mahiu get sub-stations for passenger rail services.
