Former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo is fighting a bruising legal battle for the ownership of a multimillion-shilling prime land in Eldoret. He has sued Mary Njoki Muya for illegal possession of a section of his plot block 14/1167 in high end Eldoret’s Elgon View estate valued at Sh100 million. The politician told the court that his efforts to access the plot had been thwarted by the woman whom he said is the age mate of his mother. He said that the plot is earmarked for sale to a bank, which has already paid him a Sh1.6 billion deposit with a balance of Sh183 million. “I’ve on many occasions been unable to access the parcel of land as the old woman who has intruded into my plot threatened me with a panga forcing me to run for my dear life,” Mr Jirongo told the court in Eldoret last week amid laughter. He was responding to a question from defence lawyer James Njuguna who wanted to know why he hardly inspects the plot that he alleges to possess. He was witnessing as the director of Kuza Farms and Allied, which is administrator of the parcel of land in question. He said that he has used the same parcel of the land as a surety to get a loan from Post Bank Credit. It also emerged that the seven-hectare plot has changed hands severally since 1962. The accused woman claims to have been living on the same plot since 1962 as a squatter and has vowed not to vacate the property until she is settled somewhere else or given a share of the property. The case will continue on July 2. Two weeks to the October 26, 2017 repeat presidential poll that had been ordered by the Supreme Court, Mr Jirongo was declared bankrupt because of a Sh700 million debt.
