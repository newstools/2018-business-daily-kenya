Bribery claims have led to the disbandment of Busia County Assembly’s Budget and Appropriation Committee putting in limbo the approval of the County’s 2018/19 budget on time. The defunct committee, which was headed by Nangima MCA John Obwogo was accused of demanding Sh79.5 million or Sh1.5 million for each member for approval of the Sh7.7 billion budget proposal for financial year 2018/19. The heads of the majority and minority parties now have a task to select new members before the end of the month, which is the deadline for approval County budgets. Other members of the committee included David Kokonya (vice-chairman), Eunice Nyongesa, Julius Ochou, Julius Otieng', Vincent Olumbe, Grace Tata Olita, Taabu Were and Margaret Achungo. Speaker Bernard Wamalwa confirmed receipt of a report from the two heads of the house expressing their willingness to recall their members from the committee. “As a speaker my role now is to pronounce parties wish to reconstitute their membership in the committee. The committee is therefore disbanded,” he said. He, however, assured Busia residents that House business would continue as normal and that the budget would be passed before the end of the month. Mr Obwogo has vowed to seek legal action following the disbandment. Minority leader Felix Omanyi warned that gross misconduct would not be tolerated in the House. “We are clean and have never demanded bribes. What we asked the committee is to explain some allocation in the estimates that we felt were unsupported. As a committee chair that was the last thing we expected from Mr Obwogo the reason we disbanded the team.”
