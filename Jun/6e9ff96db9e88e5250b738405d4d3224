The crackdown on betting and gambling machines has been opposed in court on grounds that the shutdown discriminates against small players. Activist Okiya Omtatah has sued Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangâ€™i, his principal secretary Karanja Kibicho and county commissioners, over the crackdown and wants them to be personally liable for destruction of the machines. Mr Omtatah claimed that there is more harm in the society from online and digital gambling platforms operated by multinational companies more than the local small businesses being targeted. He has accused the sued parties of being agents of the multinational companies hence they are personally acting to eliminate local competition.
