A storm is brewing after a section of Narok leaders opposed Deputy President William Ruto’s directive to 2,400 illegal settlers at Maasai Mau Forest to leave the water tower. The leaders led by Narok North MP Moitalel Ole Kenta, Maasai elders, and former Transport Licensing Board chairman Hassan Ole Kamwaro, Wednesday dismissed the order, saying Mau block is a trust land that under the Constitution belongs to the Maasai community. At the weekend Mr Ruto while touring the area said the government plans to issue title deeds to Mau Forest settlers and rebuild 15 schools that were demolished in the 2005 eviction but said that those who have encroached will be evicted. He added that the government had allocated Sh60 million to facilitate the reopening of the schools. Speaking at Sogoo High School, in Narok South, Mr Ruto supported a planned eviction of "legal occupants’ of the section of the Mau Forest, reiterating that environmental conservation was crucial for the country. “In the Mau Forest we have a clear cutline. All those beyond the cutline who have encroached the forest must be evicted. Mimi sitaki mchezo (I am not joking),we agreed about this. Only those who have not encroached the forest will be issued with title deeds," said DP Ruto. It is this remark that has raised political temperatures in Narok County. Mr Kenta wants the 2003 Ndungu Commission report on irregular allocations of public land be implemented forthwith.
