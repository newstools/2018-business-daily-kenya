Kwale International Sugar Company (KISCOL) will from next month start packaging their sugar into smaller units to tap the local mass market. Speaking at the factory last week, the company's Community Relations Manager Mathias Mutua said they were selling sugar in 50-kilogramme bag. "We are are packaging sugar into smaller units of 500g, 1kg and 2kg packets as we aim at the mass market," he said. The firm, which started operations in 2015, will also follow in the footsteps of rivals that brand their sugar. Mr Mutua said the company has capacity to produce 400 tonnes of sugar per day. He said they had 120,000 bags to supply to the country in their stores. "We have buyers from Mombasa and as far away as Nairobi because of the quality of our sugar, we are able to sell at least 2,000 bags daily," he said. He said they plan to increase production by taking advantage ofthe fact that cane grows faster at the coast compared to other areas in Western. The Sh17.8 billion Kiscol factory was built on the grounds of the collapsed Ramisi Sugar factory. Kiscol has been banking on its modern factory to improve production. It is Kenyaâ€™s 12th sugar miller in an industry dominated by loss-making and debt-laden State-owned firms such as Mumias, Nzoia, Sony, Muhoroni and Chemilil. Private players in the sugar industry include West Kenya, Sony, Kibos, Butali, Transmara and Sukari millers.
