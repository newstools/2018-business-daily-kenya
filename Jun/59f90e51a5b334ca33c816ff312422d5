Hotels, lodges and tented camps in the Maasai Mara Game Reserve are fully booked ahead of the wildebeest migration next month. Managers of the facilities said all is set for the wildebeest migration season, adding that they may be forced to seek alternative accommodation for excess visitors. Sarova Mara managers Duncan Mwangi and James Pere reported near full capacity booking from next month to September. “We are having near-full capacity through the months of June, July and August and so far we haven’t witnessed any cancellations or other challenges,’ said Mr Mwangi who attended a pass out ceremony of 42 rangers on a refresher course for a month. The annual migration from the Serengeti in Tanzania to the Maasai Mara in Kenya is one of the greatest natural spectacles. It is the world’s largest migration, involving more than two million animals in search of greener pastures in Kenya. It usually starts in July and ends in October. Hoteliers anticipate an increased number of visitors because of the “handshake” between Opposition leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta. In an attempt to control the flow of tourists and investments into the park, Narok Governor Samuel Tunai ordered control of traffic and human movement to the reserve.
