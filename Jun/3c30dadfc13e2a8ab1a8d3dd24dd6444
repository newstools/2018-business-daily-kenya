Deputy President William Ruto has said he will submit himself for a lifestyle audit amid his allies’ opposition to vetting of top State officials. Mr Ruto, speaking on Wednesday during the 43rd Annual National Conference of Principals in Mombasa, said every leader will have to undergo such scrutiny in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s renewed fight on corruption. “It (corruption) is a serious threat. We cannot attain the Big Four agenda if these vices are not tamed. That is why I will also undergo the lifestyle scrutiny,” his press team quoted him as having said, adding his wealth has been the subject of social media rumours. “The other day I saw the media trying to write something on what I own. Well…I thought they would continue the following day with another leader. But I saw nothing…it seemed the agenda was me because it started and ended on me”. His allies have termed the audit as selective and laced with a political agenda. At the moment, the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act requires all State Officers to declare their wealth but such information is not made public. MPs and Senators, for instance, declare their wealth at the start of their term but that information is kept by their respective speakers, away from public scrutiny.
