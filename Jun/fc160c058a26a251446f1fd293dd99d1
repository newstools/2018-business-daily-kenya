The European Union is providing a grant to youths in technical institutions and small businesses across eight counties that are prone to radicalisation. Under the grant, Kenya Red Cross Society — which is the implementing partner — pays tuition fees to the institutions depending on the number of youths selected. Small and medium businesses get at least Sh100,000, besides training to grow their ventures. “This initiative brings youth into Kenya’s national priorities and the Big Four Agenda. It will strengthen their social and professional skills, enhancing job creation,” EU ambassador to Kenya Stefano Dejak said on Thursday. The initiative on conflict prevention and economic empowerment for youths aims to benefit 4,500 Kenyans between 18 and 35 years. At least 3,800 youths across Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Tana River, Kwale, Kilifi, Lamu and Mombasa counties have benefited so far. The EU is funding the programme, under the Emergency Trust Fund, to the tune of Sh2.2 billion. Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs Margret Kobia said the government was committed to partnering with the EU, the Kenya Red Cross and other organisations to empower youths. “They will be more focused in a peaceful environment where they will thrive economically,” she said.
