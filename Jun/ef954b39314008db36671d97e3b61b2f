The Nairobi—Mombasa passenger SGR trains are fully booked over the three-day Idd-ul-Fitr weekend. Kenya Railways (KR) managing director Atanas Maina said yesterday the trains are fully booked from today all the way to Sunday. Each passenger train pulls 16 coaches (1,535) people in economy class and two (72 passengers) in the first class. “The trains are fully booked from June 15 to June 17. Passengers started booking seats as early as last month and by last weekend, they were full,'' he said. Mr Maina said that there has been an increase in the number of people traveling between the two towns, especially in economy class. “There is no shortcut. If you want to avoid last minute disappointments you must book early enough. The booking window is 30 days,’’ he said. Currently, two express trains depart the two cities every afternoon, one leaves Nairobi at 2.30pm and the other leaves Mombasa at 3.15pm. On the other hand, two inter-county trains leave Mombasa and Nairobi at 7.15am and 8am respectively.
