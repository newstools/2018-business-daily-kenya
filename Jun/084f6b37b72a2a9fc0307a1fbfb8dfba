Embattled Nakuru County Assembly Speaker Joel Maina Kairu has escaped a motion to impeach him. The motion to kick him out of the office was defeated when it failed to attain the required 75 per cent of MCAs votes. During a heated debate that culminated into the voting by 77 members out of the 78 MCAs, those supporting his removal garnered 45 votes while those opposed to his ouster managed 32. However, the majority did not carry the day owing to the 75 per cent vote threshold as per the assembly standing orders. Earlier before the voting in a hushed House, Mr Kairu had denied all the accusations leveled against him. He was accused of embezzling public funds, misuse of office and corruption among others. “I am innocent and I have never been involved in corruption or embezzlement of the public money since I was elected as Speaker nine months ago,” said Mr Kairu. “This is witchhunting and I forgive my accusers and call upon them to join me in developing this great county,” said Mr Kairu after the vote. He thanked Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika, Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama and Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria for supporting dialogue to end the stalemate. “These are the true leaders of Nakuru and those who have been fighting me disguised as peacemakers should now be ashamed of themselves,” added Mr Kairu. Biashara Ward MCA Peter Njoroge Wanyaguthie moved the motion, saying Mr Kairu was not fit to be the Speaker. “Mr Kairu single handedly appointed two nominated MCAs to the County Assembly Service Public Board without following the law,” argued Mr Wanyaguthie. Chairman of Budget and Appreciation Committee and Elemantaita Ward Rep Ndung’u Kamau accused Mr Kairu of high handedness and lacking leadership qualities. “We need a Speaker who will unite all the 78 MCAs for the betterment of Nakuru County and not a bully Speaker who wants us to kneel before him,” said Mr Ndung’u.
