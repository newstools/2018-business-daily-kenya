Former Chief Government Pathologist Moses Njue was Monday charged with another case of stealing a man's heart. Dr Njue is accused of stealing the heart of Benedict Karau in March 2015 at Consolata Hospital in Meru while performing an autopsy. The pathologist also faced two other charges of removing the heart without permission and destroying Mr Karau’s heart. He denied the three charges leveled against him; including stealing, removing and destroying a body part of a deceased person before Meru chief magistrate Lucy Ambasi. Dr Njue, who now serves as chief executive officer (CEO) of Embu Teaching and Referral Hospital, was released on Sh500,000 cash bail. In May, Dr Njue denied allegations of stealing the heart of Timothy Mwandi Muumbo at Lee Funeral Home while performing an autopsy on June 25, 2015. On Monday, his lawyer Victor Adande made a pitch for his release on bond. “I wish to apply for the reasonable bond term, he is a CEO Embu Level 5 hospital and therefore in the interest of justice I ask the court to grant him a personal bond,” Adande pleaded. State prosecutor Claire Muriithi did not object on the bail terms. Last month he moved to the High Court seeking to stop the first criminal trial, also at a magistrate’s court where he is charged together with his son Lemuel Anasha Mureith. They accused the State of “selective prosecution,” claiming that some individuals were being shielded. The two have sued the DPP, the Inspector General of Police, the Director of Criminal Investigations and the magistrate court in Milimani.
