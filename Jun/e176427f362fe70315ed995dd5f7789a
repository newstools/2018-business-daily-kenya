Newly appointed Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) acting managing director Daniel Manduku has reported to work a day after the High Court lifted orders suspending his appointment. Dr Manduku says he is optimistic about improving efficiency at the port of Mombasa and boosting trade. “I reported to work as directed by the court in compliance with the court order,” the MD said Wednesday on phone. According to the board that ousted his predecessor, Catherine Mturi-Wairi, inefficiency and cargo clearance delays at the port contributed to her exit two weeks ago. “We were unable to evacuate a lot of cargo to our clients. It was also due to lack of effective leadership, non-responsive work culture, consistent failure to implement board resolutions, the absence of explicit performance targets and the failure to implement them,” said Michael Maina who chaired the board meeting. Last Friday, Ms Mturi-Wairi wrote to Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia informing him of her decision to resign after 25 years at the Authority. Her resignation came against a backdrop of two court cases filed at the High Court and the Employment and Labour Relations Court challenging the board's decision to send her on compulsory leave. She became the first woman MD of the Authority following her appointment in June 2016, coming after former managing director Gichiri Ndua was sacked in February the same year.
