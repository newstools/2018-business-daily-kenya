Siaya County Governor Cornel Rasanga has sent packing more than 50 staff for alleged involvement in corruption and inefficiency. The county boss said employees the department of Finance and Planning are on compulsory leave as part of his latest efforts to sanitise the unit. In a move that closely mirrors the recent national government directive that saw all heads of procurement sent home, Mr Rasanga said the officers will have to be vetted afresh before they are allowed back. “While all staff sent on leave are not guilty until proven otherwise, the period of their absence will afford my government an opportunity to scrutinise the activities of each directorate and recommend measures of improved efficiency and service delivery,” said Mr Rasanga in a statement sent to newsrooms. The governor said he was acting in line with his campaign promise to take steps towards greater efficiency in operations of Siaya county. “If need be, those found culpable of poor and inefficient service delivery will see a wide range of appropriate action taken immediately,” he said, adding that he plans an overhaul of the finance department. Other units He also promised it was only the beginning and that the purge would be extended to all departments in a bid to weed out corrupt officers in his government. County staff in the roads department could be next in line if threats issued in his Madaraka Day speech by the governor is anything to go by. During the holiday celebrations last Friday, Mr Rasanga directed the county secretary to ensure all workers in both Roads and Finance are sent home before the end of this week. He had directed Roads Executive Bernard Mboha to finalise the report of corruption activities that had been taking place in the department since its inception and forward it to his desk for further action.
