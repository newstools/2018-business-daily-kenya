The building that collapsed and killed two people in Huruma was due for demolition after it was found to be structurally unsafe for occupation. Patrick Mwangi, the Deputy County Commissioner Mathare sub county Sunday said that it was already earmarked for demolition and residents had been asked to vacate. “It was built close to the next houses and although we ordered people to vacate others sneaked back. When the building collapsed it fell on the adjacent one and those who died are residents of the building,” he said. Deputy director National Disaster Management Unit (NDMU) Pius Masai said illegal power connections were slowing down their search and rescue efforts. Although he did not confirm how many people were missing, unofficial reports indicate that 11 of the 12 families who lived in the building are yet to be accounted for. The five storey building which is in Ngei was audited by the National Building Inspectorate (NBI) last year along with 4879 others in the country. The NBI had declared 650 building structurally unsafe for occupation in a preliminary audit report it released early this year after it was called in to ascertain their fitness. In Huruma alone, 388 of the 2011 buildings audited were found to be very dangerous while 85 are on Thika road and 65 in Pipeline area of Nairobi. The agency has been conducting a series of demolitions since the beginning of the year in Zimmerman and other parts of the city.
