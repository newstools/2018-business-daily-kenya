Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has suspended Devolution executive Vesca Kangogo for insubordination. The move follows Ms Kangogo’s trip to the United States last week against the governor’s instructions. County Secretary Peter Kariuki has written to Ms Kangogo asking her to proceed on leave pending a satisfactory explanation for travelling without the governor’s permission, an act the letter terms insubordination. “It has come to the attention of this office that you travelled to the United States on June 1, 2018, having received express instructions from the governor not to proceed on the trip prior to departure. Your failure to obey lawful instruction from your appointing authority is tantamount to insubordination and therefore you are hereby directed to step aside from your duties and responsibilities,” the letter dated June 5 reads in part. It is copied to the governor. The Devolution and Public Service Management executive has been asked to provide a satisfactory response within seven days. Ms Kangogo was first appointed to the Finance docket when Mr Sonko came into office — after serving as the vice chairwoman of the County Public Service Board in former governor Evans Kidero’s regime. She was moved to the Devolution docket in February. Ms Kangogo’s suspension is the second after former Finance executive Danvas Makori, who apparently succeeded Ms Kangogo in the same docket, was sent packing. Mr Sonko suspended and then sacked Mr Makori for “working with my enemies”. Contacted for comment, Ms Kangogo said she was yet to receive the letter. “ Let me respond tomorrow because by the time I left the office at 5pm I had not received it,” she said.
