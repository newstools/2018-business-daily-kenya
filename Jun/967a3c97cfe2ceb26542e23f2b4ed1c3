The County Assembly has passed a motion seeking to compel the electoral agency and the National Land Commission (NLC) to clear the air on the boundary row between Kisumu and Nandi counties. The motion moved by Nominated MCA Caren Muga on Wednesday wants Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and the land commission to visit the border and state clearly where the boundary is to quell rising tension between communities living across the border. The MCAs said the continued push by Nandi Governor Stephen Sang to claim part of Kisumu could threaten the existence of the Lake Region Block since the two are part of the body, formed recently to push for the economic interests of over 14 counties in western and parts of Rift Valley. Mrs Muga pointed out that the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga was meant to foster peace, saying utterances made by Governor Sang’ would only derail the peace currently prevailing across the country. READ: Nandi headed for clash with Kisumu in boundary review bid Mr Sang’ stirred controversy two weeks ago when he indicated that he will be presenting a petition to relevant authorities to seek a re-adjustment of the county borders, and have Miwani, Kibos, Kibigori, Kopere, Chemelil and Muhoroni towns within Nandi borders. The IEBC is the agency charged with drawing internal boundaries while the National Lands Commission checks the land ownership claims by various entities. The boundary row has sparked tension among traders along the border, slowing down investment in agriculture and microfinance sectors. According to some residents, the two counties stand to lose heavily in terms of revenue generation following fears of insecurity unless government solves the dispute. “Sang’ has awakened the devil in most people. He could come clean and tell us whether the clashes at the Kisumu/ Nandi border were a wider scheme to extend the boundaries,” said Mrs Muga.
