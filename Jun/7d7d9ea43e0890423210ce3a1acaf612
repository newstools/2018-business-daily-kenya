Vihiga County government has revised its 2018/19 revenue collection target downwards after failure to meet a target of Sh220 million. The county only managed to collect Sh193 million for 2017/18, according to a report by the Controller of Budget. The Wilber Ottichilo-led administration has instead proposed to collect Sh153.7 million in new financial year. This was revealed on Thursday when MCAs approved the county's Sh6.4 billion 2018/19 spending plan. While presenting the document for approval, Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman Zachariah Murefu complained about the reduced target saying the county will heavily depend on national allocation. "It is notable that the treasury's revenue target for 2018/19 has been revised downwards," said Mr Murefu. He went on: "This implies that the county will remain dependent on the national allocation." "The Budget and Appropriation Committee therefore recommends that the government should aggressively pursue a robust revenue administration policy with all the relevant laws," added Mr Murefu when he presented the committee's report in the House. He said that there was need for the executive to draft Bills that support ailing revenue collection and forward to the assembly for enactment. He also called for the revamping of the revenue department and acquisition of a better revenue software.
