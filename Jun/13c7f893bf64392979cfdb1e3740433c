Britam   has launched a Sh725 monthly medical cover targeting pastors in a product aimed at easing the burden on church members who are increasingly settling bills for the clerics. The insurer on Tuesday inked a deal with the church-backed SMEP micro finance bank with an eye on nearly 10,000 pastors aligned to National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) to sign up for the ‘Chunga Mchungaji’ cover. The insurance product comes with a Sh500,000 inpatient cover, a maternity cover of up to Sh30,000, accident cover of Sh200,000 and a last expense cover of Sh40,000 for an annual premium of Sh8,700. NCCK Secretary General Canon Peter Karanja said the cover will help pastors to settle medical bills without turning to the flock for cash donations. Insurance firms are increasingly targeting the uninsured to boost sales and profits. Insurance penetration — the ratio of the value of insurance premiums to GDP — is less than three per cent in Kenya.Britam is targeting annual premiums of Sh100 million from the pastors cover. Britam Group MD Benson Wairegi said the cover is in line withe the universal health care plan.
