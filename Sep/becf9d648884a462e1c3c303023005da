Tana River governor Dhadho Godhana has urged locals to join cooperative societies to boost their income. Speaking in Bondeni village on Sunday, the governor said the savings and cooperatives societies would prevent farmers from exploitation by middlemen. He regretted that the farmers had abandoned a Sacco started in 2010. He accused the farmers of failing to conduct annual general meetings for the Sacco and only rush to the county government for help. "We started a cooperative here since 2010 with three tractors, 10 collection centers, a 200acre land, offices and board rooms, a library full of books, had accounts with money, today if someone will hear that you have had a cooperative all these years but have made no progress, he will be surprised,” he said. He advised the locals to change the attitude and join the Sacco and cooperatives, where they will also be able to get loans hence realizing progress. "Maybe you have not understood these things, but I urge you to sign up into the Sacco and the cooperatives and you shall reap the gains," he said. Governor Godhana also said the administration had started plans to expand farming at the Hola irrigation scheme, and was currently expanding acreage from the initial 500 acres to 2400 acres. He said the administration had entered into an agreement with Swedish government, that will see major investments in the field of agriculture, and also farmers empowered to take on bigger challenges to return the county to its position in the national economic platform. "We have already started plans to expand acreage at the Hola irrigation scheme, we are also in partnership with Sweden for major agricultural projects in bid to make our county a food basket, and place it back to its position in our national economy,” he said.
