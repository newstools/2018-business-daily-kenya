Jubilee Insurance   has raided Minet Kenya Brokers and Seven Seas Technologies (SST) Group for top managers to head its life and general businesses in Kenya. Roselyne Meriko from SST Group was appointed the general manager of the life insurance and pension business while Winnie Mbugua of Minet Kenya will hold a similar position in the general insurance business. Jubilee Holdings regional chief executive Julius Kipng’etich said the appointments are in line with the firm’s plan to grow and strengthen its business. “We believe in empowering women at Jubilee Insurance and this is an exciting time for the organisation as we now have two strong-minded women taking over at the top to lead our two largest business lines,” said Mr Kipng’etich. He said the underwriter is leading the next wave of disruption in the industry by ensuring that the insurance solutions are an exact match for their customers and they are easily accessible at their convenience. Ms Meriko will be primarily responsible for developing the capacity for business growth through creation of new products and innovative solutions and enhancement of the overall operations framework. Ms Mbugua is expected to drive strategy and operations aimed at strengthening the efficiency of systems and processes. Jubilee said she will also champion business development in that business.
