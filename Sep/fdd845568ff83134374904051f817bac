Investment among counties under the Lake Region Economic Bloc (LREB) is set to advance after they incorporated their trade and investment strategies in the Big Four Development Agenda to drive economic growth in the region. The counties want to maximise on the shared resources to attract local and international entrepreneurs to increase investment opportunities in the region. “We are collaborating with national government agencies, the private sector and development partners to maximise on shared resources,” said Mr Wycliffe Oparanya, the LREB chairman. The 14 governors under the bloc are to hold the Trade, Investment and Economic Development conference in Bomet County next month to fast-track the process. Members of the economic bloc include Bomet, Bungoma, Busia, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kericho, Kisii, Kisumu, Migori, Nandi, Nyamira, Siaya, Trans Nzoia and Vihiga counties. Nandi County has already incorporated its County Integrated Development Plan in the Big Four agenda and allocated additional resources to healthcare, manufacturing, food security and housing to propel socio-economic development. “We have aligned our budget to the Big Four Agenda whose key pillars were part of my campaign manifesto and plan and mobilised resources to implement the plans,” said Nanid Governor Stephen Sang. The strategy was launched on Monday by Deputy President William Ruto at Kapsabet showground. The national government has allocated Sh800 million to expand Kapsabet Referral Hospital and buy new machines.
