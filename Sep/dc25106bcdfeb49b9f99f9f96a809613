Migori Governor Okoth Obado has been arrested over the murder of his pregnant girlfriend Sharon Otieno. Mr Obado was on Friday morning grilled by detectives at the headquarters of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on Kiambu Road in Nairobi. He spent the better part of the morning with detectives and sources said he was expected to record a statement on the matter. His arrest comes a day after detectives and government scientists confirmed that the baby boy ripped from Ms Sharon Otienoâ€™s womb was his, thus putting the Migori governor at the heart of investigations into the abduction and killing of the Rongo University student. The foetus died after the mother was stabbed eight times while seven months pregnant. A postmortem report indicated that the fatal blow to the baby was a single knife stab through Ms Sharon's abdomen. Police sources saidthat the governor is now a person of interest in the investigation and will have to record another statement in Nairobi, alongside his wife Hellen. Mr Obado last week recorded a statement in Kisumu.
