Kenyan retailer Tuskys has announced that it will invest Sh200 million to set up an electronic store within its outlets, following a store-in-store model. The store-in-store "will stock a variety of premium consumer electronic products while providing a state of the art experiential platform" Tuskys said in a statement. The retailer previously employed a similar model with its clothing shop dubbed Mavazi in its outlets. “As part of the Tuskys Business Development strategy, we are responding to a consumer demand for immersive electronics stores that allow them to experience the products at their optimum performance,” Dan Githua, group CEO of Tusker Mattresses said. While describing the new stores as the future of electronics sales, at the launch of the first Tuskys Multi-Brand Electronics Departmental store at Tuskys T-Mall, Nairobi, Mr Githua said the stores will provide a purpose designed platform for customers to interact with products from leading manufacturers. The manufacturers include Samsung Consumer Electronics, Sony Electronics, Beko Electronics, Moulinex, ELBA, LG, Ramtons among others. The Tuskys Multi-Brand departmental stores will also feature a beauty section catering for beauty and grooming related appliances alongside a mini Apple Store operated by the local Apple Products dealer. As part of the launch, Tuskys will award customers with up to 50 per cent discounts and double loyalty points. In the recent months, the supermarket has embarked on expansion with new branches in Kericho, Eldoret and Nairobi in race for dominance.
