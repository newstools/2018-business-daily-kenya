The Aga Khan Hospital Mombasa has opened a clinic in Voi town, Taita Taveta County to take services closer to clients who travel all the way to Mombasa for treatment. The Voi centre will work closely with Mombasa branch hospital to ensure smooth patient referrals and admissions when necessary. The centre is complete with a radiology, ultra sound, laboratory, a well stocked pharmacy with cost effective drugs, a nurse and a doctor to offer outpatient services. The centre which opened its doors to patients Wednesday is expected to be officially launched soon. Speaking on phone, the hospital’s outreach manager at the Coast, Janet Mzigo said the clinic will provide quality healthcare services to patients. “The opening of the new clinic is a boost to provision of quality healthcare services in the region,” she said. She said speciality services such as maternal care, cardiology, nephrology, paediatrics and genecology, which are much needed in the area, will be launched later. Speciality services will be offered once a week, she said. Ms Mzigo also said they had requested the Taita Taveta Health department to offer free vaccination and family planning clinics at the centre to promote child and maternal health. “Were are in talks with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) to enable members to get free services at the clinic,” she said. The Voi centre will be among six other outreach clinics in the region which include Mtwapa, Nyali, Ukunda, Bofa Kilifi, Bamburi and Changamwe clinics.
