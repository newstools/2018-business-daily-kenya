Films regulator has banned Pwani Oil’s Fresh Fry and a Marie Stopes advertisement that have been running on radio and TV for containing sexual content and supporting abortion, respectively. The Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) reckons that the adverts are in breach of the law, which bans abortion and promotion of sexual content before 10 pm. The advert by Pwani Oil had a setting on the shore of an ocean showing a woman seducing a man. KFCB said the Marie Stopes advert was promising relief to women with unplanned pregnancy and suggesting a solution for safe abortion. The adverts were not submitted to the board vetting before publication, KFCB chief executive officer Ezekiel Mutua told a press briefing yesterday. The Films and Stage Plays Act demands films be submitted to the KFCB for examination and classification ahead of licensing and airing. Those in breach face a fine not exceeding Sh100,000 or a five- year jail term or both. “The Board also demands that Marie Stopes issue a public apology for airing such content without submission for examination and classification,” said Mr Mutua.
