Marine transport operator Kenya Ferry Services (KFS) is once again on the spot for failing to account for Sh1.8 billion it used to buy two ferries from Turkey. Auditor-General Edward Ouko says in his latest report on the Mombasa-based agency that he was unable to confirm the validity and accuracy of the building and supply of the ferries at a cost of Sh1,863,000,000 nor the propriety of expenditure totalling Sh1,519,379,614 paid to the contractor as at June 30,2017. The report says verification of the bid evaluation process revealed that the contract was awarded to a bidder who was ranked fourth during technical evaluation but no explanation was provided as to how he was ultimately awarded the job. Besides, the audit found that the technical evaluation report had indicated that the winning bidder was to supply　Roll on/Roll off ferries and that dead weight at designed draft was 490 tonnes but a review of the winning bidder’s tender document revealed that the bidder did not provide this information. KFS was also found to have made a down payment of Sh598,023,000 ($5,920,726.7) to the local appointed agent in August 2015 despite the requirement　that such payment be made upon production of an unconditional bank guarantee issued by an established reputable bank located in Kenya. The audit found that the winning tenderer submitted a performance bank guarantee　 of Sh93,150,000 ($931,500) issued by a foreign bank located in Istanbul, Turkey, in clear breach of the requirement and there was no　evidence showing that due diligence was done to establish the validity of the guarantee. "It was further noted that the performance bond dated July 13, 2015 was submitted 16 days after signing the contract contrary to paragraph 10 of General　 Conditions of the contract which required the contractor to furnish the employer with the performance security before signing off the contract," Mr Ouko says in a qualified audit report on KFS submitted to the National Assembly. The audit also found that KFS made an advance payment of Sh598,020,000 ($5,920,726.7) to the company but failed to withhold six per cent of value added tax (VAT) totalling Sh35,881,380 and withholding tax at 20 per cent for non-resident company totalling Sh119,604,380 despite professional advice from the Kenya Revenue Authority to subject payments to both taxes. The chief government auditor said the new ferries were to be delivered after 17 months or by November 2016 according to the contract signed on June 27, 2015. "However, the first ferry (MV Jambo) was delivered in July 2017 being nine months after the set timeline. In addition, as at the time of audit in October 2017, the second ferry had not been delivered and information available indicates that delivery of the vessel was suspended by a court order," Mr Ouko says in the report. "In light of the foregoing, it has not been possible to confirm the validity and accuracy of the building and supply of two new ferries at cost of Sh1,863,000,000 and propriety of expenditure totalling Sh1,519,379,614 paid to the contractor as at June 30, 2017," Mr Ouko says.
