Hundreds of small-scale traders fear losing millions to a ‘sacco’ that is not on the regulators list of licensees after it recently closed down. Winsight Sacco based at Kitengela started in 2015 but shut down two months ago to the desperation of a reported over 2,000 members who were eyeing long-term projects and loan benefits. Licensed saccos are listed on https://www.sasra.go.ke/index.php/regulation/licensed-saccos#.W59zx2NRWM8. The public on Monday threatened to storm an office suspected to be associated with the outfit in the town before police intervened. The members drawn from Kitengela, Isinya and Mlolongo towns were contributing between Sh200-300 each on a daily basis. Despite prior agreement on long- and short-term loans members interviewed said they had never been given any loans on grounds that pending loans by others exceeded the sacco’s capital. At the beginning of the year, the ‘sacco’ leadership changed and members were reassured that upon saving funds for the next six months they would receive their dues and accumulating interest from the savings. However, to the shock of members it closed down upon the maturity period. Documents in our possession show bank transactions of deposits made to the sacco account, receipts, meetings and correspondence to members on their monies. Some members say they have lost up to Sh400,000 going by bank slips and receipts. Maina Ngugi who ekes a living as a motor mechanic said he had lost Sh300,000 he was saving to set up a modern garage. "I was very optimistic to boost my business in later days without knowing I had entered into a trap. The sacco loan has not been forthcoming even with my business suffering financial crunch,'' said Mr Maina.
