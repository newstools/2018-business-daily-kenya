Australian firm Base Titanium Ltd has appointed lawyer Desterio Oyatsi as chairman of the Kwale-based miner. The move to pick Mr Oyatsi, the managing partner at Shapely Barret & Company Advocates and President Uhuru Kenyatta’s lawyer, follows the retirement of Prof Joseph Maitha after eight years of service. Prof Maitha will continue as a non-executive Director of Base Titanium Ltd until December 31. Mr Oyatsi has been on the firm's board since 2016 with the miner saying in a statement that he brought a wealth of experience to the role. “We are confident that Mr Oyatsi will build on the successes of Professor Maitha, to whom we are grateful for his leadership, service and wise counsel,” said Tim Carstens, managing director of Base Resources, the Australia-based parent company of Base Titanium. Career He joined the board two years ago along with investment banker John Ngumi and analyst Aly-Khan Satchu at a time when the miner was expanding its directorship. The appointments were seen as geared towards boosting the voice of Kenyans at the firm's top leadership. The lawyer, an Advocate of the High Court, is also chairman of Kenyatta family-owned lender Commercial Bank of Africa Group and insurer Metropolitan Life Insurance Kenya Limited. Mr Oyatsi sat on the board of oil marketer KenolKobil Limited   between 2007 and 2016. He also previously served on the boards of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) and Telkom Kenya Ltd. Mr Oyatsi held brief for Mr Kenyatta on legal matters including at the International Criminal Court (ICC) where the president, his Deputy William Ruto and Joshua arap Sang were charged with crimes against humanity. Base Titanium Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Australian and UK-listed Base Resources Limited. Its flagship development is the Kwale Mineral Sands Mine, located 50km south of Mombasa. Construction of the mine was completed in 2013 and the first bulk shipment of mineral sands departed from Mombasa in February 2014.
