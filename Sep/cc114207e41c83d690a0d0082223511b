Safaricom Investment Co-operative (SIC) plans to diversify its investments from real estate to other businesses to grow its revenues by 30 per cent. SIC board’s real estate committee chairperson Rosemary Chege said the sacco had also identified health, education, agribusiness as well as low-cost housing future investment alternatives in the next five years. “As board members of SIC, we will continue holding such forums to fresh ideas from our members as we implement our strategic plan for 2018-2023 period. “We are looking at various options to also grow our membership as well as grow our share capital that currently stands at over Sh1.5 billion,” she said. SIC official Felix Akuku said they were in talks with some county governments to partner in the construction of low-cost housing units. “We have held discussions with Nairobi and Kilifi county governments where we intend to use our experience in building houses to put up affordable units on identified county land,” he said.
