The Safaricom pension scheme has received approval from roads authorities to link its Sh4.4 billion Athi River homes to the Nairobi-Mombasa highway, easing tenants’ access to facilities such as Nairobi Hospital, Naivas and Java. The Kenyan National Highways Authority (KenHA) and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) gave permission for the construction of a 500 meter tarmacked road. The project is nearly 90 per cent complete with 40 per cent of houses sold, while its mall in the gated community is expected to have a 50 per cent occupancy by end of year, says the pension scheme. The planned road will ease connection between Nairobi-Mombasa highway and the property dubbed Crystal Rivers that sits on 25 acres of land. “We have ramped up the works to ensure that Crystal Rivers will be open to the public by the peak of the December festive season. “As of now, Naivas is at an advanced stage of fitting out their premises while other tenants such as Java and Nairobi Hospital are in the process of commencing their works,” Safaricom Pension Scheme secretary Richard Gitahi said. Mr Gitahi spoke at a forum to update home buyers, mall tenants and supervisory agencies on the project and obtain feedback from regulators on its compliance status.
