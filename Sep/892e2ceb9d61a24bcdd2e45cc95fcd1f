HF Group Managing Director Frank Ireri has proceeded on a medical leave to receive specialized treatment, with about six months left before the end of his contract. The mortgage financier’s chairman Steve Mainda said in a statement, without specifying the duration of the leave. “On behalf of the board, management and the entire HF community, we wish Mr Frank Ireri a quick recovery and look forward to him resuming his duties as soon as possible,” said Mr Mainda. During his absence, the board has tasked the current HFC bank, Managing Director Sam Waweru to take over the running of day to day activities for the Group. Mr Ireri becomes the latest boss of a listed firm to take a medical leave. In October last year, Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore took a medical leave. His leave lasted for nine months.
