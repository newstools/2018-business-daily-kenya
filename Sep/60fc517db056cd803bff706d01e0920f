Former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo will remain in police custody until Thursday after he failed to raise Sh5 million cash bail to secure his freedom. Deputy Registrar Elizabeth Tanui directed that he should remain in police custody until today 1pm, when he is expected to have raised the money for his release. The court, however, directed that the former flamboyant politician be taken to remand prison should he fail to pay the bail. Businessman Bryan Yongo wants him jailed for failing to settle a Sh20 million debt. The warrant of arrest against Mr Jirongo had been issued by the court on August 6 and the OCS Muthangari Police Station was directed to execute the same with utmost speed. Mr Jirongo had earlier agreed to pay the debt saying that he was going to give it priority after selling his 500 acres of land in Ruai, in Nairobi and another five acres in Kisumu. He was also expecting compensation from the Nairobi County government for a plot in Industrial Area. However, his failure to settle the debt prompted Mr Yongo to apply for warrants of arrest against him. He wants him committed to civil jail for failing to repay the amount, which was advanced in 2014.
