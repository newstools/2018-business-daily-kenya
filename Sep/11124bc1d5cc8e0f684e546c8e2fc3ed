Hoteliers in western Kenya have been asked to upgrade their services and register their facilities with the relevant organisations for ease of operations and ranking. Speaking at the county government offices in Kisumu, Tourism Regulatory Authority chairman Samuel Nyule said proprietors of hotels must list with Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers. "Hoteliers must be incorporated in this entire initiative by ensuring that they register their facilities with recognised bodies such as the hotel keepers association," said Mr Nyule. He said that caterers should ensure that the kitchen, customer care, transport and rooms are conducive for guests. Mr Nyule said while there are wonderful and attractive beaches at the Coast, the western region boasts of having Lake Victoria as the second largest fresh water lake in the world and, therefore, an ideal tourism attraction site. He further added that plans are underway to involve the hotel owners and transport providers to ensure that the tourists get excellent services equivalent to the money they spend. The Executive for Tourism, Sports, Culture and Communication Achie Alai said that despite having a remarkable tourism potential, the western region is yet to maximise the sector. "This sector can play a remarkable role in the economic growth of the region," said Ms Alai. Ms Alai added that for tourism to be vibrant in the region, partnership with other ministries in the county such that of environment must be enhanced.
