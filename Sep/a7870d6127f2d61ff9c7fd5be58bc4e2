Kwale County has received a major boost after Base Titanium mining company donated a cryotherapy machine worth Sh500,000 to be used in the treatment of cervical cancer. The company's Community Relations Manager Pius Kassim said following the donation, the company together with Kwale’s health department and the Ministry of Health have commenced a five day training programme for 28 nurses picked from all sub-counties in the county. He said the machine will be handed over to ensure it is party of the training programme. "The provision of the machine and the support to train the nurses in partnership with the county will go along way to improve health services for residents seeking medical attention," he said. He added that the firm's community programmes are closely aligned with the County Integrated Development Plan and will partner with the county government to ensure development priorities are met. County Nursing Officer Edward Mumbo said the equipment is geared towards improving healthcare services in the county. “We are grateful for the donation as this will help the residents of Kwale diagnosed with cervical cancer to access treatment and fight the disease, leading to better health outcomes," he said.
