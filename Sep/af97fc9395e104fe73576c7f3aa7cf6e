Taita Taveta County is set to lay off a section of its workers to cut down its high wage bill. Speaking in Wundanyi, governor Granton Samboja said the county government will terminate contracts of some workers in a bid to invest more in development projects. He said his government was using 57 per cent of the county budget to pay salaries for about its 3,000 workers. “We use 190 million to pay salaries every month. We are reaching a point where I think we will be forced to trim the work force,” he said. He said the executive wing of his government had conducted a meeting with the county assembly to deliberate on the way forward concerning the issue. He said the Senate had raised its concern about the county’s high wage bill which he agreed resulted in little funds set aside for projects. “We will pay all their benefits. By putting more money in development it will open more opportunities for our people,” he said. He said the county government was working towards ensuring that they seal corruption loopholes especially in revenue collection. He said the in last financial year the county collected over Sh200 million up from Sh170 million in the previous year. He warned that those found embezzling county funds will face disciplinary actions. The governor said the improvement in revenue collection will save his government from relying on Treasury for survival. However, workers in the county are yet to receive their August salaries due to challenges of cash flow from Treasury. A source within the Finance department said permanent and casual workers had not been paid as the county government heavily relies on the national government to fund its operations.
