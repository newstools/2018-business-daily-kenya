The owner of Westgate Mall, Sony Holdings Limited, has moved to court to challenge a Sh380 million tax claim after the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) slapped it with the bill, even after it applied to Treasury for exemption. The firm says it had applied to the Cabinet Secretary of Treasury for exemption from taxation on grounds that it suffered losses of income and incurred cost rebuilding after its building was damaged in a terrorist attack in 2013. Sony Holdings claims that KRA in May 2018 got hold of the application and issued with demand, which the firm notes is unlawful and unreasonable. “A judicial review order…and is hereby issued…quashing the respondent’s assessment orders dated May 18, 2018 posted on I-Tax system on even date, making additional assessment based on the assessment letter from respondent dated May 18, 2018 and the objection decision letter dated August 10, 2018,” reads one of the order sought by Sony Holdings. The firm says its mall was destroyed on September 21, 2013 leading to its closure for rebuilding until July 18, 2015 when a portion was reopened. The firm says its woes started in March 2017 when it applied to the CS for exemption from withholding tax on rental income due to loss it suffered. Sony Holdings copied the letter to KRA, a move it alleges prompted the taxman to swing to action. The KRA reduced the tax amount to Sh380 million covering financial year 2014 to 2016 from Sh1.1 billion after the Westgate Mall owner raised objections. The taxman is demanding Sh221 million arising from Sh600 million insurance compensation in 2014, which it classified as revenue, and Sh159 million tax arrears covering 2016. However, the firm faults the decision to classify the Sh600 million as revenue noting that the total insurance compensation was Sh3.1 billion, and yet the reconstruction expense is Sh4 billion, leaving it with a deficit of Sh944 million to raise to complete the work. It accuses KRA of making the demand before the CS acts on its request for exemption.
