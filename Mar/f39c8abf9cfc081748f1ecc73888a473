Estonia-based firm Taxify has launched a motorbike hailing service as it moves to tap into the mode of transportation popular for its convenience in Nairobi. The new Taxify Boda service has a minimum fare of Sh50 per trip. For longer journeys, users will be required to pay Sh30 base fare, Sh15 per kilometre and Sh3 per minute. Taxify Kenya Operations Manager, Chisom Anoke, said that the firm had developed the new service in response to a growing demand for safe, organised and reliable motorbike services. “Rising use of motorcycle riders for public passenger transport is a reality that we have to live with particularly in Nairobi where traffic jams and clogged roads delay movement,” he explained on Thursday. Mr Anoke said that by providing a smartphone application linking passengers to motorcycle riders, Taxify Boda is contributing to the overall structuring of the informal transport economy, estimated to already ferry at least 10,000 people daily in Nairobi alone. “We want to help the motorcycle drivers formalise their businesses by providing them with a platform to track trips, earnings and even plan for personal development initiatives such a saving with a sacco. Since they are already trying to establish formal groupings, Taxify Boda will greatly raise their operational focus and even eventually make it easier for them to afford to purchase new motor cycles,” Mr Anoke said.
