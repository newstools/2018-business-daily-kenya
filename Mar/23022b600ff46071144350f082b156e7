The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) has warned the public against fake job advertisements doing rounds on social media. In a statement, the official statistics body says it has not invited Kenyans to apply for any job openings linked to next year's census, adding that those behind the advert are fraudsters. A fake advert has been doing rounds on social media, especially WhatsApp groups, inviting applicants to take part in the 2019 Kenya population and Housing Census. The notice is purporting to recruit 6,573 senior supervisors, 25,831 supervisors and 151,936 enumerators countrywide. “Applications should be received by noon, June 29, 2018 for senior supervisors and supervisors, and by July 4, 2018 for enumerators,” it says. “We would like to bring to the attention of the public that KNBS has not placed and job advertisement for 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census,” said KNBS in a statement Tuesday. “The recruitment processes are free, fair and do not involve exchange of money or favours. We caution the public to be wary of such fraudsters purporting to recruit on behalf of the bureau,” the government body added. Fraudsters often use sham job adverts to con unsuspecting job seekers out of their money. READ: Kenya to obtain 170,000 digital tablets for population census next year
