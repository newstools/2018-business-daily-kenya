The Kwale County Assembly on Wednesday unanimously passed a motion seeking to ban the sale and consumption of Muguka as it eyes banishment of the commodity from the entire coastal region. The motion, introduced by Kasemeni MCA Anthony Yama, says its consumption is destroying the lives of hundreds of youth and marriages. "This motion urges the county government to ban the supply of muguka leaves as a key to address the current spate of youth violence and moral decay," he said. Dzombo MCA Patrick Mangale supported the motion saying that they want to breed a generation that is responsible. "From the look of things 10 years to come and the rate at which Muguka is consumed then we will not have responsible youth to lead this county." He asked the county government to enforce the ban and make sure there will be no supply. 'No economic value' Minority leader and Mkongani MCA, Ndoro Mweruphe, also supported the motion saying muguka has no economic value to the youth in Kwale. Mr Yama claimed its consumption has contributed to increased number of school drop out in both primary and secondary schools. "There has been poor performance in schools as youth are not concentrating on education and in the near future we may not have children going to school," he said. He said that the youth are no longer contributing to the national economy as they spend most time consuming the drug instead of working. "They can't work, can't look for jobs, only what they do is to use the drugs provided they have Sh50," he said. Other counties Mr Yama also said he plans to engage all other coast counties to also enforce the ban so that the region will be muguka-free. "We have done our part and we will be mobilising other counties in the region to impose the ban," he said. READ: MUGO: Why muguka farming is a curse and not a blessing
