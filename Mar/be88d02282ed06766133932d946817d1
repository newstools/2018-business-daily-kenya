The Education ministry has sent a team to investigate Murang’a High School principal over reports that the institution forced parents to pay Sh40,000 for a harambee to build classes and a swimming pool. The probe started as more parents complained that the school had withheld their children’s leaving certificates for failing to pay the Sh40,000. The cash is for a harambee that was supposed to be presided over by Deputy President William Ruto on April 6. The school targets to raise Sh45 million for the two projects. According to Murang’a County Director of Education Victoria Mulili, the team visited the school on Friday on a fact finding mission after media reports highlighted the parents’ concerns. Ms Mulili said the team will be releasing its findings next week. “The team from Jogoo House (the ministry headquarters) spent the better part of Friday at Murang’a High School to get the truth of the matter; we shall make known our findings by next week,” the county director said. Among the issues they are scrutinising are whether the school followed due process before seeking parents’ contribution. To collect such contributions, the school writes to the county education board and the director forwards the request to the Cabinet Secretary who has the final word. The county director said she was new to the station and did not know the details on how parents and the school agreed on the matter.
