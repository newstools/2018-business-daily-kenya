Shelter Afrique has appointed Namibian Daniel Nghidinua to chair its board at a time the troubled pan-African housing financier is undertaking an overhaul of its business. Mr Nghidinua, who replaces Jean-Paul Missi from Cameroon, said the special focus will be on regaining shareholder and investor confidence. “This will be done through running a more transparent and responsive organisation as well as improving staff engagement,” he said upon appointment. He brings to the board management experience and business knowledge from numerous government positions he held. The technocrat — who takes over the chairmanship of the 11th Shelter Afrique board — currently serves as Ministry of Urban and Rural Development PS. He holds a Masters of Science degree in public policy and management from the School of Oriental and African Studies, UK and a Bachelor of Administration in economics and development administration), from the University of South Africa. Mr Missi remains a member of the board. The Shelter Afrique board recently approved a new strategy that shifts the business to large-scale affordable housing projects through public-private partnerships. “Mr Nghidinua will oversee positioning of the company as an investment-grade organisation and a capital drive which will include opening membership to new Class C shareholders,” said Shelter Afrique in a statement.
