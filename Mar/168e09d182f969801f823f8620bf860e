American Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will return to Washington a day ahead of schedule, Reuters news agency reports. This comes after he cancelled a day of events in Nairobi last Saturday due to illness. “The Secretary is not feeling well after a long couple days working on major issues back home such as North Korea,” the Associated Press reported last week. He had been scheduled to hold an interactive meeting with Health Secretary Sicily Kariuki at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital on Saturday at 9am but the event did not take place. However, he had met with President Uhuru Kenyatta and had talks on regional security, Al-Shabaab and conflict in South Sudan. Update: Tillerson's spokesperson says the Secretary of State cut his Africa trip short to deal with urgent work in Washington. According to Reuters, he will now spend just a few hours in Nigeria on Monday evening rather than stay overnight as originally planned. Tillerson travelled to Chad on Monday morning to meet President Idriss Deby, an important American ally whose military is battling al Qaeda and Islamic State-affiliated groups in the Sahel region. He will then visit Nigeria before flying home later the same evening. Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer whose security forces are battling Boko Haram Islamist militants in the northeast.
