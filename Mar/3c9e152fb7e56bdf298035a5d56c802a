Coffee prices at the auction remained flat this week as the trading continues to receive low quality beans with the main crop season almost coming to an end. A market report from the Nairobi Coffee Exchange (NCE) indicates a 50-kilo bag of coffee was sold at Sh25,755 on Tuesday which is the same price that it fetched last week.The price of the commodity has been on a downward trend in the last one month after impressive performance previously. The prices have been on an upward trajectory since the first sale of 2017 to last month following an increase in high quality beans from farmers. “The quality of coffee that we are now getting at the auction has gone down and this is what has affected the price,” said NCE chief executive Daniel Mbithi in an interview last week. The coffee that is trading at the auction currently is coming from the main crop season in central Kenya.
