One of the world’s top law firms, Dentons, has struck a partnership deal with Nairobi-based Hamilton Harrison & Mathews Advocates (HH&M), giving it a foothold in the Kenyan market. Dentons said the deal with HH&M will enable it to strengthen its service offering to multinational clients expanding into Africa with Nairobi as the regional hub. “This combination provides clients domiciled in East Africa, and clients from other jurisdictions with a made-to-fit suite of legal services premised on local knowledge, depth and scalable options,” Dentons global chairman Joe Andrew said in a statement. The partnership is still subject to regulatory approvals. Dentons, ranked among the top 20 legal firms in the world, has a presence in 73 countries, including Uganda, Egypt, Morocco and South Africa.

Dentons said the deal should enable it to pursue its ambition to become a pan-African law firm. “Our expansion in Kenya with one of the largest firms there will help us build our East Africa presence in Uganda, as well as our pan-Africa presence,” Noor Kapdi, managing partner for Dentons South Africa and head of operations in Africa, said. “Building on outstanding practices, each firm will offer even greater value by providing a more robust legal platform in all of the markets clients do business,” HH&M  senior partner Richard Omwela said.
