Nyandarua County has been selected for trial of the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) programme as the national health insurer prepares to widen coverage. The programme guarantees the residents a package of health services, including the coverage of needy residents by the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). It will also involve equipping of health facilities. Deputy governor Cecilia Mbuthia said Nyandarua was selected as the pilot county in the UHC initiative during a third health sector stakeholders’ meeting held in Nairobi “after serious lobbying.” “What this means is that our county will benefit from national level support on free NHIF for residents in the next four years, and benefit from development partner support and even private sector investments,” said Ms Mbuthia, who is also in charge of the county health department. She adds that UHC is the new direction in the health sector in the country.
