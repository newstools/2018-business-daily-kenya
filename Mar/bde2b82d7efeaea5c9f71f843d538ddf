Kenya Revenue Authority Commissioner-General John Njiraini has dismissed as baseless claims that he should have left office six months ago. In further reply to a suit filed by activist Okitya Omtatah, Mr Njiraini said all allegations touching on his pending retirement are also premature and highly speculative. He said before moving to court, Mr Omtatah never bothered to enquire whether KRA has put in place relevant processes to ensure that his successor is in place. He further said assertions that he has applied for renewal of the contract is not true. The case will be heard this Friday before Labour Relations court Justice Nelson Abuodha. The Judge had last month rejected a move to suspend Mr Njiraini pending the hearing of the case. READ: KRA silent as Njirainiâ€™s term comes to an end Justice Aboudha ruled that Mr Njiraini was a man of means and can be ordered to refund whatever money he would have received as KRA boss, if the court finds that he is illegally in office. Mr Omtatah moved to court last year arguing that Mr Njiraini should be on terminal leave, pending his retirement. Mr Omtatah argued that Mr Njiraini reached the mandatory retirement age of 60 years on December 19.
