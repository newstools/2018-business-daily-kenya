President Uhuru Kenyatta jetted in on Monday morning from a landmark State visit to Cuba. The visit, according to the Presidential Strategic Communications Unit, “steered bilateral relations and cooperation between Kenya and the Caribbean nation to a new level”. Doctors It focused on trade, heritage and, mainly, health, which forms one of the key pillars of the Big Four agenda. Mr Kenyatta used the visit to get back on track health agreements signed earlier but never implemented. This has paved the way for Kenya to bring in 100 medical specialists – with each county getting at least two – and dispatch 50 doctors to Cuba for specialised training. The president and his delegation arrived at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport aboard a Kenya Airways  commercial scheduled flight shortly before 7am. He was received by Deputy President William Ruto, Chief of Defence of Forces General Samson Mwathethe and Nairobi Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko among others. Thereafter, President Kenyatta inspected a guard of honour mounted by a detachment of the Kenya Air Force.
