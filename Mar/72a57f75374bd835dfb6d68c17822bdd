The promotional Sh700 fare on the standard gauge railway (SGR) “Madaraka Express” train between Nairobi and the coastal city of Mombasa will be adjusted upwards in May. Kenya Railways managing director, Atanas Maina, said Thursday that he charges will be adjusted to Sh1,000 from Sh700 for economy class passengers following approvals by the Transport Ministry. The Sh3,000 fare for first class passengers, however, will remain the same in the new price regime likely to be opposed by many travellers. Mr Maina had in February indicated that ticket prices for economy class travellers would go up starting April, subject to approvals by the Transport Ministry. “Starting May 1, we will be charging Sh1,000 on the Madaraka Express passenger service for economy class tickets. First class fares will however remain the at Sh3, 000,” said Mr Maina in an interview with the Business Daily. The SGR train was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta last June to transport passengers between Nairobi and Mombasa. The president then fixed the fares at Sh700 for economy class tickets and Sh3,000 for first class travellers between Nairobi and Mombasa. This was a reduction from the initial Sh900 that had been announced earlier by Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James Macharia.
