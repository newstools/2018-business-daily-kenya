Countdown to clearance of Sh58 billion unpaid bills owed to contractors by Nairobi County Government started on Tuesday after former anti-graft tsar PLO Lumumba was sworn into office. Mr Lumumba, who is former director of the Kenya School of Law, said contractors had 21 days to table documentary proof of tenders awarded to them and how they executed the same to completion. The huge contractors’ unpaid bill arises from commercial engagements between contractors and the Nairobi City Council as well as its successor Nairobi City County Government. Acting County Secretary Leboo ole Morintant said the Lumumba-led team is expected to establish a roadmap initiating payment for undisputed and verified claims. “Governor Mike Sonko wants to ensure genuine suppliers and contractors are paid their dues without further delay. This process will also stamp out cartels where a foolproof procurement system will be set up to manage future bills,” said Mr Leboo. Mr Lumumba said his 10-man committee will sit at County Hall to receive the contractors where documents will also be scruitinised and the county government advised on the way forward. The committee has been given the leeway to recommend payment as well as identify unscrupulous contractors.
