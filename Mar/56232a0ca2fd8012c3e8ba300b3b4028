Governors are pushing for more inclusion in decision making for integrated transport system in Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos, Murang’a and Kajiado counties. The governors are calling for incorporation of county executive committee (CEC) members in charge of transport to the Board of the Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (Namata) in what they say will help avert conflict during implementation. The nine-member board includes the chair, principal secretaries in charge of transport, roads and National Treasury, CECs responsible for transport in the five counties, three independent persons and a director general. “The Board needs to factor in the county heads in charge of planning alongside those in charge of transport in order to avoid conflicts during actualisation of decisions made,” Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu told the National Assembly committee on Transport.
