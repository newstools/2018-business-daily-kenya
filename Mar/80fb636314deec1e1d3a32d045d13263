Matatu operators are now required to provide details of their mechanics in the National Transport and Safety Authority’s (NTSA) latest attempt to curb road carnage. The NTSA now requires the operators to provide copies of contracts for mechanical services as well as weekly inspections. The operators are also required to provide details of their route inspectors, office managers and account clerks including level of education and phone numbers. “The vetting is intended to ensure improved levels of compliance by saccos and companies with the aim of deregistering those which are not conforming to relevant laws and regulations,” said NTSA director-general Francis Meja in a notice. The NTSA has directed operators of public service vehicles (PSVs) to download, fill and submit the vetting forms detailing the routes they ply, evidence of tax compliance and sacco/company pin by March 20. The operators are required to provide evidence of insurers, list of policy numbers as well as copies of receipts for fare paid.

Kenya is ranked among countries with the worst road safety records globally based on a 2015 World Health Organisation (WHO) report titled the Global Status on Road Safety. Some of the worst road accidents last year occurred near the Salgaa blackspot along the Nakuru-Eldoret road claiming 36 lives. The accident involved a bus belonging to Matunda sacco and a truck. Government records show that about 3,000 Kenyans die from road accidents annually, a figure the WHO differs with and places at 12,000.
