Reports that Starehe Boys Centre workers went on a go-slow on Wednesday complaining about work conditions, including poor pay, confirm that trouble has no boundaries. Starehe is a household name and any troubles at the institution jolt the entire education fraternity. Although it was built to support bright and needy students, meaning its workers have to demonstrate a unique ability to serve including sacrifice, the management ought to appreciate that basics like inflation affect all and sundry. One of the ways to cure such gaps is using subsidies like providing food and affordable housing, which may already be in place in the goal of uninterrupted learning at a model centre like Starehe. But going forward, the alumni under the Old Starehian Society should move with speed and nip the brewing crisis in the bud. One, they know the centre’s traditions better and could  help the management reflect on what it stands for and return the school to its former glory. Two, the government should not allow the school, private as it is, to slide into oblivion. We urge all stakeholders to ring-fence the school with dedication, commitment, and open communication against any form of instability.
