MPs have approved the nomination of spy chief Noordin Haji and former Court of Appeal judge Paul Kihara Kariuki for appointment as the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) and Attorney-General respectively. The Committee on Appointments and the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chaired by William Cheptumo endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta’s nominees for the positions. “The committee recommends that the House approves the appointment of Mr Noordin Mohamed Haji as the Director of Public Prosecutions,” said Mr Cheptumo. The Committee on Appointments chaired by Speaker Justin Muturi also approved Justice Kihara’s nomination to replace Githu Muigai. Mr Haji, who is the son of Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji, is the current deputy director in charge of counter-terrorism at the National Intelligence Service and takes over from Keriako Tobiko who was appointed a Cabinet minister. During his vetting, Mr Haji told the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that no one will be spared in the war on corruption. “From the questionnaire submitted, the committee observed that his net worth was approximately Sh313 million,” said Mr Cheptumo in a report. The Committee on Appointments also disclosed Justice Kihara’s worth. “His sources of income during the calendar year preceding his nomination and the current calendar year comprise salaries and emoluments. His financial net worth is Sh166 million,” says the House team in its report.
