American-based agricultural equipment manufacturer and distributor, AGCO, in partnership with Strathmore University have launched a training programme aimed at driving African agricultural prosperity. Following the launch of the training programme, 20 students were enrolled. The new training initiative, dubbed AGCO Agribusiness Qualification (AAQ), is an accredited two-year agribusiness programme for students aged between 20 and 30 who already hold a degree. On completion of the course, successful candidates may have the opportunity to join AGCO and its partners. The course is a joint effort by AGCO, Strathmore Business School (SBS) in Nairobi, Harper Adams University in the UK and Kenya-based The Bridge Africa which runs programmes to prepare graduates for employment. “This is an important day for agribusiness education in Africa and I warmly congratulate our new students on gaining their places on the programme. The AAQ was initiated by AGCO as a direct response to attract and develop young talent in the crucial agribusiness sector,” said AGCO Senior Vice President and General Manager Asia-Pacific and Africa, Gary Collar. The course syllabus covers areas such as agricultural mechanisation, leadership skills, business management, agricultural science, marketing and farm management. “Together with our partners, we are making a long-term commitment to address the management skills’ shortage. We are determined to foster the expertise required to work successfully in the agricultural supply chain and tackle the current recruitment challenges our industry faces here,”  he said.
