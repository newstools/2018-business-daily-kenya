Alcoholic spirits’ manufacturer Africa Spirits Limited (ASL) has injected Sh200 million towards acquisition of specialised equipment for non-refillable bottle cap closures for its premier product, Legend Brandy. ASL’s Head of Marketing Nyawira Kariuki said the new machinery will see their bottle cap closures re-designed thereby making it difficult for unscrupulous businesspeople to replicate. In the past, incidents have been reported of popular alcoholic beverages suffering reputational damage and heavy business losses when unwholesome and low-quality spirits branded in their names and bottles are sold to unsuspecting members of the public. “Our investment is meant to boost confidence in our products among members of the public. Through innovation, we are creating appropriate and effective anti-counterfeiting strategies to distinguish our products in the market,” she said. The new bottle caps closure technology makes it difficult for recycling with individual pubs advised to return the bottles to their Thika-based plant. Globally, alcoholic spirit manufacturers are increasingly adopting the use of non-refillable closures with distinct identification features as part of quality control. Other ASL products to done the new non-refillable bottle closure caps soon will be Bluemoon Vodka range, Furaha Brandy, Furaha Vodka and Gypsy King. Ms Nyawira added that the new-look bottles will also bear responsible drinking messages. The firm which started off operations in 2004 manufactures alcoholic beverages for all market segments.
