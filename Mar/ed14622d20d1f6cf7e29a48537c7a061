Robbers over the weekend broke into the Habib Bank AG Zurich on Koinange Street and made away with an unknown amount of money. They entered the branch through the rear door at an undetermined period, went to the second floor of the building, disabled the alarm and CCTV surveillance cameras before accessing the banking area. They used gas and welding machines to break into safes before attempting to break into the strongroom. Nairobi County Commander Joseph ole Tito said the robbers used papers to block the bank’s tinted glass windows so that security guards could not see what was happening. “They took their time because we have found leftover food meaning they even had the time to eat inside the bank. They have really done a lot of destruction, but they did not manage to get into the strongroom,” Mr Tito said. The leftovers of githeri, beef, chicken, rice and chips, which were in disposable plates, were found on the counters and the floor. The strongroom, according to one of the officers, contained Sh41 million, which was still intact when detectives opened it Monday morning. Mr Tito, Nairobi County Director of Criminal Investigations Ireri Kamwende, Central DCIO Samuel Kobinas, OCPD Robinson Thuku and other senior police officers were investigating the robbery. Mr Tito said they suspected that the robbery was staged by people familiar with the bank. “This must be an inside job, by people who knew how to access the bank through the rear gate, the location of the CCTV cameras, the alarm, the safes and the strongroom,” Mr Tito said.
