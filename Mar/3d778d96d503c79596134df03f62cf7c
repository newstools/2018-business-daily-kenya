The fast trains introduced last year to boost transport between Nairobi and the coastal town of Mombasa will not be available to ease the pain of last-minute travellers as the Easter holiday season starts. Holidaymakers will instead have to seek alternative means of transport as early bookings appear to have overwhelmed the Madaraka Express. Kenya Railways Corporation managing director Atanas Maina said: “The train is fully booked on March 30 to April 2. There are only a few seats available on April 1, but this will be filled up even before the close of business today,” he said. Mr Maina said there has been an increase in the number of people travelling between the two cities due to the promotional fares, which have been in existence since last June.“To avoid inconvenience, passengers must learn to book in advance. It’s the only secret that has not been mastered by the majority of our customers,” he said. Currently, two express trains depart the two cities every afternoon, one leaves Nairobi at 2.30 p.m and the other departs Mombasa at 3.15 p.m. READ: SGR passenger fare to be hiked in a month On the other hand, two inter-county trains leave Mombasa and Nairobi at 7.15 a.m and 8 a.m respectively traversing six counties through the Maisenyi, Voi, Mtito Andei, Kibwezi, Emali and Athi River termini. Passengers travelling between the two cities pay Sh700 on economy class and Sh3, 000 on first class. The corporation also charges Sh50 from Mombasa to Mariakani, Sh230 from Voi to Kibwezi, Sh130 from Athi River to Emali, Sh510 from Nairobi to Voi and Sh400 from Emali to Maisenyi on economy class coaches. On first class, passenger pay Sh140 from Mombasa to Mariakani, Sh920 from Voi to Kibwezi, Sh660 from Athi River to Emali, Sh2,130 from Nairobi to Voi and Sh1,670 from Emali to Maisenyi. Kenya Railways is, however, set to increase Nairobi-Mombasa fares by 42 per cent to Sh1,000 in May to pay the Chinese firm operating the rail.
