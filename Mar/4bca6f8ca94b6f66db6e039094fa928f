The National Land Commission has moved to end the row over compensation and issuance of title deeds which is threatening to derail the construction of a Sh63 billion water project in Elgeyo-Marakwet County. The commission in conjunction with the Ministry of Lands officials have embarked on a two-week inspection and valuation of the project as the per the recommendations of a taskforce, which was constituted to look into complaints by locals. “We want to establish the number of people who will be displaced by the project and how much the affected will be paid as compensation,” said NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri. “We also want to secure public utility land. Surveyors are currently in the process of erecting beacons in the project area,” added Swazuri. The project to be established at Kimwarer area (Sh28 billion) and Arror (Sh35 billion) will see more than 10,000 acres of land placed under irrigation and water for domestic use provided to households. The ambitious project is expected to serve over 50,000 people living in the highland and lower land parts of the vast county upon completion.

Kerio Valley Development Authority managing director David Kimosop said the authority in collaboration with the regional and national government was addressing all the pertinent issues raised by the community. “All the grievances raised by the families who will be affected by the construction of the dam are going to be addressed and I do not see the reason why they should resist the project,” he said. “Most of the families have proposed swapping of land as part of the compensation and measures have been put in place to settle them elsewhere under mutual agreement in the next six months,” added Mr Kimosop. Both projects are in Kerio Valley.
