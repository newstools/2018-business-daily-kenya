Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia says individuals against construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) through the Nairobi National Park are busy bodies trying to derail government projects. He said the individuals are maliciously trying to slow down an investment that will benefit Kenyans. Speaking at the port of Mombasa during a tour of the facility yesterday, Mr Macharia issued a warning to detractors saying the government will not allow them to derail the project. “Anybody trying to abuse the process meant to benefit 45 million Kenyans won’t be allowed. We will protect national interest over individuals,” he said. Conservationists have protested the construction of the rail line through the park in the capital saying the multi-billion shilling project will destroy its ecosystem. They have also accused the government of beginning SGR works despite a court injunction. “We have a key critical project in terms of the SGR which is serving the people of this country. You have seen the difference it has made in terms of phase one from Nairobi to Mombasa now carrying about 6000 passengers every day. What we won’t allow is busybodies who are maliciously trying to slow down the investment,” added the CS.
