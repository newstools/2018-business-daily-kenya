A subsidiary of South African-owned Sanlam Group, the largest shareholder of NSE-listed insurer Sanlam, has paid Sh105 billion ($1.05 billion) to acquire the stake in SAHAM Finance that it did not already own. In a statement, Sanlam Group’s Chief Executive Officer Ian Kirk described it as a strategic move that positions the company as a pan-African insurance provider. SAHAM’s insurance business, which started its strategic development in Africa in 2010, is now present in 26 countries through 35 insurance companies. Saying Saham would be transformed into a Pan-African Investment Fund, its group’s spokesman Moulay Mhamed Elalamy said they planned to partner with international investors such as the World Bank, Kingdom Zephyr, Abraaj, Allianz, Bertelsmann, Wendel and the Sanlam Group to implement major projects across Africa. “As part of its transformation, SAHAM will now attract new partners, to break new ground and invest in future-oriented businesses, development accelerators for our continent,” said Mr Mhamed, whose firm initially held a 53.4per cent stake in Saham. Sanlam provides insurance, investment, financial planning and retirement advice to individuals, businesses and institutions. Sanlam Group, which is headquartered in South Africa, spent Sh403 billion last year on strategic investments across Africa. Sanlam reported a one-per cent drop in group headline earnings to Sh824 billion in financial results for the year ended December 2017.
