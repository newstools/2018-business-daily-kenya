The shilling held firm to the gains made against the dollar last week in Monday’s trading as support continued to come in from portfolio investors into the market. Commercial banks quoted the currency at an average of 100.85/101.05 in the afternoon, having opened the day at a similar level. There was fairly muted demand for the dollar last week, which saw the shilling gain 0.4 per cent against the greenback to close the week at a five-week high of 100.95 on average. “In the new week, we see the shilling holding within the current ranges, although with a slight bearish bias should demand for the greenback recover,” said Commercial Bank of Africa in a market note on Monday. READ: Shilling weakens on importers’ dollar demand The end-of-the-month period usually sees heightened dollar demand form importers looking to settle overseas obligations to their suppliers, meaning that this week the shilling may struggle to hold below the 100 level to the dollar. In the year to date, the shilling remains in positive territory against the dollar, having strengthened by 2.3 per cent. The market is also alive to the increase in the foreign reserves held at the Central Bank of Kenya, which gives the regulator greater muscle to smoothen any volatility in the exchange rate.
