The High Court has ordered the release of lawyer Miguna Miguna from detention at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi. Justice Roselyn Aburili issued the directive after lawyers representing Dr Miguna sought his unrestricted entry back into the country. The judge directed that the activist be immediately released and that he presents himself before the court on Wednesday. Lawyers John Khaminwa, Nelson Havi and Julie Soweto sued Interior secretary Fred Matiang’i, Immigration boss Gordon Kihalangwa, Inspector- General of Police Joseph Boinett and Directorate of Criminal Investigations investigations director George Kinoti. They have also sued the officer commanding police division at the JKIA and the Attorney-General. In sworn suit documents, the lawyers claimed that Dr Miguna had been held incommunicado in a toilet at Terminal 2 at the airport and that his Canadian passport had been withheld.

Dr Miguna arrived in the country on Monday at 2.30pm. However, the court was told that State agents at the airport attempted to violently put him aboard an Emirates Airline flight destined to Dubai on Monday night.
