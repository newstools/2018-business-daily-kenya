German premium beer Warsteiner is now available in Kenya after having signed an exclusive distributorship deal with local firm Maxam. Maxam will be distributing the high-end beer in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in its first foray into the East African market. The distributor plans to spend about Sh50 million in building a brand’s profile of the beer in the region, improving its distribution network and training local vendors. Maxam managing director Ngugi Kiuna said the product launch followed research that identified a market gap and latent demand for quality alcoholic beverages. “Consumers want a great experience when taking the drinks and we have realized that they place great emphasis in associating with globally acclaimed premium brands,” he said. 'Strong liking' “We are confident that the Kenyan taste buds will take a strong liking for the Warsteiner premium beer, which is now available in 330ml non-returnable bottles,” Mr Kiuna said. There are plans to introduce the canned variety as well. Mattijs Jongmans, Warsteiner's director for Africa, said the beer had grown to gain a foothold in more than 70 countries on five continents. By coming to Kenya, Mr Jongmans said, Warsteiner's high quality and brewing traditions would contribute in shaping the future of Kenya’s beer industry. “In Germany and abroad, we have continuously worked towards and achieved an excellent and trustworthy reputation. We brew our beer according to the German Purity Law, which means the beer only contains 4 natural ingredients and has no additives,” he said. The privately-owned beer maker was founded in 1753 by Antonius Cramer in the German North-Rhein Westphalian city of Warstein and remains in the hands of his family. The alcoholic beverages industry in Kenya has recorded remarkable growth over the last half a decade.
