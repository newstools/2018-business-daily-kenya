An M-Pesa agent has been charged in a Nairobi court with conspiracy to defraud Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Wanjiru Chege. Catherine Nyaboke was dragged to court after she was found to have registered a Safaricom   line in the name of Ms Chege. She denied five counts of attempted fraud when she appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Martha Mutuku. The court heard that she allowed the registration of a Safaricom line on March 3 at Update Beauty Shop in Donholm area, Nairobi County. It is alleged that she registered the line to Waziri Benson Masubo, with intent to defraud MPs and the public. The court directed her to deposit Sh100,000 or Sh200,000 bond with one surety to secure her release. The case will be heard on April 26. READ: Safaricom rally lifts NSE to Sh2.83trn all-time high
