Nairobi County will experience rains between today (Thursday) and Monday next week as the weatherman forecasts heavy downpour in the capital on Friday and Sunday. A weekly report from the Kenya Metrological Department indicates the city will experience rains ranging from moderate in the mornings and heavy showers in the afternoons.   “The county is expected to experience rains over few places in the morning and moderate to heavy showers over several places in the afternoon from today (yesterday) to Monday,” says the report. “The rainfall is likely to be heavier (more than 30mm) on Friday and Sunday. On Monday and Tuesday, showers are likely to occur over few places in the afternoon,” adds the report. Nairobi has been receiving rainfall since last week with the heaviest downpour on Tuesday 6, when all the stations within the county recorded more than 17milimetre (mm) with JKIA registering the highest amount of 50.3mm.   Destruction Western, Coast, northern Kenya, Rift Valley, Central and southeastern lowlands are expected to continue receiving heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday. Heavy rains have been witnessed in several parts of the country, leaving a trail of destruction in most parts of the country. Mai Mahiu Narok road was closed on Wednesday after a section of it collapsed following heavy rains that led to flooding.   Police blocked the road and directed motorists to alternative routes. Road users from Homa Bay, Kuria, Migori Kisii, Bomet and Narok headed for Nairobi were advised to use Kericho- Nakuru route. Infrastructure Principal Secretary Julius Korir blamed the destruction on faultline, poor soils and volcanic activities as the cause of cracks that led to the damage saying the geological problem would be addressed with experts. The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) had mobilised its engineers to work on the damaged section yesterday to restore normalcy on the busy highway.
