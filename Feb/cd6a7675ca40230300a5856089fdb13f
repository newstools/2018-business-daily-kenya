The devices will be available for sale locally on March 23 following its launch at the 2018 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The devices have been redesigned with a new dual aperture lens that powers an innovative low light camera, Super Slow-mo video capabilities and personalised AR Emoji. “The way we use our smartphones has changed as communication and self-expression has evolved,” said DJ Koh, President and Head of IT & Mobile Communications Division, Samsung Electronics. The Galaxy S9 and S9 plus will have 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch displays respectively as well as 12 megapixel cameras and 8 megapixel camera for the rear and front. In addition, the 4GB and 6GB memory for the S9 and S9 plus as well as options of storage ranging between 64GB, 128GB and 256GB. Data from IDC indicates that in 2017, Samsung held 21.7 per cent of the global smartphone market, with Apple, Huawei and Oppo following with 14.8 per cent, 10.6 per cent and 7.6 per cent respectively. Samsung has been banking on better cameras and the growth of social media to boost sale of equipment. AFP reported that the world's biggest memory chip and smartphone maker has faced multiple challenges since last year, including a humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 handsets and a corruption scandal that engulfed its de facto leader. The device manufacturer has seen a turnaround of its profit tides after setting a $10 billion (about Sh1.04 trillion) for the third quarter of 2017, which was followed by a reshuffle in its top management.
