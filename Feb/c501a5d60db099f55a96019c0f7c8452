Top executives of industrial packaging manufacturers are in Nairobi this week for an exclusive conference and exhibition whose focus is to develop new materials that will enable the industry to chart the way forward in the wake of the ban on plastic bags. In Kenya, finding alternatives to plastic packaging has become more urgent following fresh proposals to extend the ban to include plastic bottles. The ban on plastic packaging found strong support among environment ministers and experts during the recent United Nations Environment Assembly session in Nairobi that has since inspired South Africa, Oman, Sri Lanka, and Chile to follow suit. The three-day Nairobi event dubbed “Propak East Africa 2018” opens this morning at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC), and is expected to attract over 3,500 visitors, 150 brands and exhibitors. It will showcase latest packaging products and solutions that comply with the new laws banning use of plastics.

Charles Campbell Clause, the managing director of Montgomery ECO, the company organising the conference, said the packaging industry is leading the global sustainability battle alongside more than 40 countries that have completely banned, partly banned or taxed single-use plastic bag. Mr Clause said Kenya’s decision to extend the ban to plastic bottles has further reaffirmed the country’s commitment to environmental sustainability. “This year we have focused our conference topics around the many pertinent issues affecting the market so that our visitors and exhibitors can use it as a chance to gain insights and understand the market opportunities available. to them,” said Alexander Angus, the Montgomery ECO Regional Director for East Africa.
