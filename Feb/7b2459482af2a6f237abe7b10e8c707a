Maize is fast becoming a scarce commodity in some parts of the North Rift as farmers hoard the little they have driving prices up. A spot check by the Business Daily in the region revealed that a bag of maize is going at Sh2,800 up from Sh2,200, while wheat is fetching Sh3,400 up from Sh3,000. “Food shortage is unavoidable as a result of erratic rainfall experienced,” said Jane Yator from Uasin Gishu County. Several families in West Pokot, Baringo, Turkana and parts of Elgeyo Marakwet counties are staring at starvation. The food shortage has partly been attributed to the decline in maize production in Rift Valley, the country’s grain basket, last season due to erratic weather conditions and attack by viral disease with agriculture experts warning that the situation may get worse this season. Matters are made worse by the hundreds of herders who have invaded ranches in search of water and pasture for their livestock. Owners of conservancies have raised concern over encroachment of wildlife habitats which they fear could diminish wildlife dealing a blow to tourism. Rebecca Kochilem, a manager at Ruko Conservancy in Baringo South County, says the persistent dry spell is a major threat to conservation of wildlife in the conservancy which holds eight giraffes, over 30 impalas and a variety of other mammals.
