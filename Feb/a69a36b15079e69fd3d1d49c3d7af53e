The Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) has issued a stern warning to hotels and event organisers serving their customers uncertified bottled water. The watchdog Tuesday said that it will take legal action against those found exposing the public to health hazards linked to drinking poor quality water. “It is a contravention of the Standards Act to manufacture or offer for sale any product unless the product demonstrates conformity to the respective Kenya standard by having a valid permit to use the standardisation mark as stipulated in the law,” said Kebs Managing Director Charles Ongwae. He said water being a high risk product, there is an urgent need to regulate it and weed out fraudulent players who are bottling and selling substandard product to unsuspecting consumers. Hoteliers, event organisers and members of the public have also been advised to confirm the validity of the standardisation mark by sending the actual permit number to Kebs' short code number (20023). “Water is listed as a high risk commodity and a slight contamination can lead to loss of lives or even sickness,” said Mr Ongwae.
