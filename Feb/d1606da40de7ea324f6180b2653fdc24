French retailer Carrefour is set to open its fifth store at Sarit Centre shopping mall in April, taking over space vacated on Sunday by struggling retailer Uchumi  . Carrefour, whose local franchise is held by Dubai-based conglomerate Majid Al Futtaim, three months ago opened its fourth store at the Junction Mall, which was previously occupied by struggling rival Nakumatt Holdings.  Its other branches are located at Thika Road Mall, Two Rivers and the Hub Mall. The retailer is set to shift to a bigger space at Sarit Centre’s new wing scheduled for completion at the end of the year.
