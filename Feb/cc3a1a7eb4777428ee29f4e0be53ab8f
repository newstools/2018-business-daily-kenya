Swedish caller ID firm Truecaller has set up its first Africa office and headquarters for the region in Kenya. The software application, popular with helping identify unknown phone numbers, has garnered six million users in the country to date. “Over the years, Kenya has consistently been a top market for us, with some of our highest usage globally, which is why it made sense for us to set up a strategic headquarters in Nairobi. With this positive momentum of growth, we look forward to bringing new, innovative and localized services and offerings, and expand our presence and start engaging more deeply with the tech eco-system,” said the firm's director of partnerships, Africa, Zakaria Hersi on Wednesday.
