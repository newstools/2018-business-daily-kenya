Dr Bitange Ndemo has been appointed chairman of a government taskforce that will explore the use of distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence for development in Kenya. The 11-member team, which has a tenure of three months, has been established by ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru and will be expected to produce a roadmap for the use of these technologies locally. A distributed ledger is a database that is simultaneously shared among many computers making it nearly impossible to erase stored records. Blockchain is the best known type of distributed ledger technology and it, in turn, is famous for being the technology that underpins Bitcoin, a virtual currency. However, blockchain has applications beyond this and is being trialled across the world for supply chain management, storing government data and even developing secure voting systems.
