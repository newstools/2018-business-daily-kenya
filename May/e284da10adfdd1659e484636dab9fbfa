Construction of Karatina Market, East Africa’s largest open-air retail outlet, is set to be completed by June 15 after the county government allocated it Sh92 million for the remaining works. Housing principal secretary Hinga Mwaura and Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua in whose area the market is located said the disbursement would end the long wait for the project, which has dragged for six years. The two said the county released Sh227 million for completion of two markets in the county — Chaka and Karatina markets. The county allocated Chaka Market in Kieni sub-county Sh135 million. “But all eyes are on this Karatina Market that has stalled for six years and which has been eliciting a lot of negative emotions from locals and their leaders,” said Mr Mwaura. He said the market was a central government project under the defunct Economic Stimulus Programme. The project stalled after the government faced acute shortage of cash to sustain the stimulus programme that sought to spur economic development. Mr Mwaura said the contractor — the Uchumi International Agencies — had abandoned work after the government failed to pay Sh32 million in arrears and did not budget for a further Sh60 million to complete the project.
