The County Assembly of Kisumu is set to purchase iPads for the 48 MCAs amid opposition from residents. In a tender notice dated May 4, published in the Daily Nation, the assembly has invited bidders for the supply and delivery of the gadgets for members of the county assembly. The IPads are meant to make the assembly “paperless” and allow the legislators t carry home assembly work and documents with ease. Kisumu residents questioned the decision to procure new gadgets instead of asking ex-Kisumu MCAs to return at least 49 ipads bought for them while in office. A row had already started brewing between the former and current MCAs on whether the gadgets were to be returned upon completion of their term. Out of 35 elective ward seats, only two members were re-elected. Only four ex-MCAs have returned the gadgets. “There is need for the assembly to go paperless. We are also in the process of upgrading the Hansard,” said Mr George Olwal, MCA for Kolwa Central and also the chairman of Planning, ICT and Industrialisation The Assembly will also upgrade its ICT infrastructure including WIFI re-installation. Bidding for the upgrade had already been done even before they were sworn in, according to the chairman. It is not yet clear how much will be used for the procurement of the gadgets at the moment, but earlier, the Assembly fought back claims it could spend as high as Sh5 million on the gadgets. Analysts estimate average lifespan of the device at over four years.
