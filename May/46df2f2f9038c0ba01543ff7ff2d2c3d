Parliament has ordered Agriculture principal secretary Richard Lesiyampe and his Research counterpart,  Hamadi Mboga, to appear before it this morning to shed light on the irregular procurement of subsidised fertiliser resulting to the loss of Sh275 million in the two financial years to June 2016. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) issued the directive after the two officials snubbed invitations to appear before it yesterday. The committee had planned to grill the two over a number of issues raised by Auditor- General Edward Ouko, key among them the procurement of subsidised fertiliser. “A lot of irregularities have been pointed out by the auditor that points to massive loss by public in terms of money sunk in that subsidised fertiliser scheme without requisite benefits,” Mr Opiyo Wandayi, PAC chairman said. Mr Ouko has questioned whether the taxpayer got value for money in the procurement. His qualified opinion is that the ministry bungled the procurement tender resulting in the loss of Sh126.8 million in the year to June 2015. He said the ministry disqualified the lowest bidder who won the tender to supply fertiliser at Sh630 million and went for the second lowest evaluated bidder without giving reasons.
