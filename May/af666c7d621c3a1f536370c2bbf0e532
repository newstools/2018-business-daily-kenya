A group of businessmen is seeking to be allowed to ferry students in their vehicles without complying with the Ministry of Education’s directive that require school buses to be painted yellow. The 28 businessmen say they have contracts with schools to ferry school children, but since their vehicles are also used by other clients they should be exempted from the rules. The businessmen are asking the High Court to issue an order stopping the police, the ministries of Education and Transport from arresting them. They want “An order restraining any arrest and charging by the agents of the respondents against the petitioners,” reads one of the order sought by the petitioners who claim to own 75 vehicles. They further want Section 105B of the Traffic Act which introduced the requirements to be declared illegal on the grounds that it’s discriminatory and that amendment was done without consultation. The amendment to the Traffic Act makes it mandatory for all vehicles ferrying school children to be fitted with the requisite safety belts, painted yellow and not operate between 10am and 5am. The amendment imposes a fine of Sh30,000 or to a jail term not exceeding two months or both and the person who permits his vehicles that does not meet the requirement to be used by school children also risks similar punishment.
