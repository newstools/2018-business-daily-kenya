East African Legislative Assembly MP Simon Mbugua and two others have been freed on Sh200,000 cash bail each after denying robbery with violence charges against a city businessman. Mr Mbugua was charged with violently robbing Mr Timothy Muriuki of Sh100,000 alongside Mr Anthony Otieno Ombok, alias Jamal, and Mr Benjamin Odhiambo Onyango, alias Odhis, and others not before the court. The hearing of the case is set for May 14. The three are accused of robbing Mr Muriuki and injuring him at Hotel Boulevard in Nairobi when goons interrupted his press conference last Monday, accusing him of seeking to speak ill of Governor Mike Sonko. None of the suspects that police link to the assault and with Sh2.5m bounty in their heads has been arrested. Mr Mbugua was arrested on Tuesday together with the suspects. One of the suspects arrested on Tuesday, Mr Stephen Sangira, was arraigned, but not charged on lack of evidence. The four were arrested at Sagret Hotel and were taken to the Central Police Station in Nairobi where they were detained until 6am yesterday when they were taken to court. Mr Sangira, a former journalist, was released on a cash bail of Sh100,000. The prosecution had sought for his detention for seven days to allow complainants identify him through an identification parade. The magistrate declined the request.
