City Hall is on the spot after a fire broke out at the maternity wing of the Mbagathi Hospital Wednesday, forcing its staff to evacuate 16 newborns who were in incubators. The county had earlier been warned to close down the maternity wing and save all patients from imminent danger but Health executive Hitan Majevda downplayed the report, saying the engineers were causing panic over an issue that could easily be fixed. Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary-general Seth Panyako criticised Mr Majevda for failing to adhere to the recommendation that the wing be shut down. “The press release purporting to reassure the public of the safety of said structure is not only insensitive but also unethical in nature and intention,” he said. An internal memo dated April 26 indicates Public Works chief officer had warned of the unit’s exposure after observing electric shocks on water pipes, showers and incubators. Mr Majevda, however, dismissed the concerns. “The maternity wing has minor cracks that have been identified by our engineers that need to be rectified and this should not stop the public from seeking services,” he said in a statement. Wednesday’s fire was attributed to an electric fault at the maternity unit. The fire is suspected to have been caused by a power blackout that plunged the hospital into pitch darkness after one of the main switches blew up. The wing was reportedly built at a cost of Sh200 million four years ago. Engineers also found that the facility had poor drainage, sagging beams and inadequate strength of structural elements of the building.
