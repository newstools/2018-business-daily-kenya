One year after the death of wealthy surveyor, and proprietor of Nakuru-based Evans Sunrise Hospital, Eliakim Washington Olweny, his three widows are still embroiled in a vicious court battle over the control of his property. The three widows have locked horns in a fierce legal succession battle for control of the late tycoon’s multi-million shilling business empire. Mr Olweny owned Evans Sunrise Hospital situated within Nakuru town,residential buildings in Nairobi,Nakuru and other towns . The first wife, Phelesiah Akoth Olweny, moved to court seeking to be granted letters of administration of the estates of the deceased without involvement of the others. She instituted proceedings before Justice Anthony Ndungu alongside his two sons, Timothy Ochieng and Edwin Otieno, and listed seven beneficiaries as the surviving wife and children of Mr Olweny. The decision seems not to have been received well by the other families who opposed the move accusing Phelesiah of sidelining them. Norah Olweny and Ann Wanjiru, the second and third wives respectively, filed applications before court objecting the petition. Norah has  accused the first wife of failing to disclose her entitlement as a widow and that of her five children in the petition for grant letters of administration.Hearing of the case is set for July 17.
