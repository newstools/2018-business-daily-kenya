Farmers whose land has been earmarked for the setting up of a Sh21 billion wind power project in Baharini Village in Mpeketoni, Lamu West, are demanding Sh1.5 million per acre compensation from the investor. The project is under full sponsorship of the Baharini Wind Power Project, a consortium of Belgian firm Elicio in co-ordination with a Kenyan company Kenwind Holdings Limited. Last week, the Malindi Land and Environment court dismissed a case filed by an American Company, Cordison International, against the National Land Commission for allocating land for the wind energy project. The investor had been unable to proceed with the project due to the longstanding dispute with Cordison. Last Thursday, the court gave the go ahead for Kenwind to proceed with the project. The more than 600 land owners said on Tuesday they were looking forward to the compensation and that they expected to be paid Sh1.5 million per acre. They expressed optimism that compensation would made faster now that the legal battle was over. The farmers’ chairman, Linus Gachoki, said they were happy that the court had concluded the case and ended the dispute. Mr Gachoki said the situation had not just delayed the project but also compensation of land owners. He however said they would not accept anything less than Sh1.5 million per acre, the same amount paid for land acquired for the new Lamu Port South Sudan Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor Project in Kililana and Mashunduani in Lamu West. Mr Gachoki said there was no reason for them to receive anything less than what the owners of land housing the LAPSSET were paid. “We thank the court for last week’s decision to allow Kenwind to proceed with the project in our village. We are now looking forward to speedy compensation since the legal war is over. Let them pay us so that we can get on with our lives.But we will only take Sh1.5 million for an acre of land here,” said Mr Gachoki.
