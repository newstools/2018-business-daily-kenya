Freedom Airline Express Limited launched flights to Kisumu International Airport on Friday, bringing the number of airlines flying to the airport to six. Freedom Airlines will at the initial stage operate on the route on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays at Sh5,500 one way and Sh11,000 return. Freedom Airline’s director for safety and quality Zephania Sylvester said the airline was considering flying to other destinations. “Part of our plan includes opening up routes to Entebbe and Mwanza with the objective of making Kisumu a major economic hub,” said Mr Sylvester. That, though, will depend on regulatory approval and upgrading of the airport to accommodate direct international and regional flights. Freedom has been operating since 2009 majorly in the north of the country. Kisumu airport general manager Joseph Okumu assured Freedom Express of support in terms of facilities, services, safety and security.

County executive in charge of Roads, Transport and Public Works Thomas Owiti described Kisumu as a virgin county with untapped opportunities thus calling on more investors to come on board. Mr Owiti said that time had come to experience inter-county air services especially for the Lake Region Economic Block counties. The colourful ceremony was graced by Ida Odinga, Dorothy Nyong’o and Antonia Owili. Mrs Odinga said that Kisumu was becoming the preferred destination for many airline operators. “The introduction of the new airline is of great economic value in terms of tourism,” said Mrs Odinga. “The story of flights are full will now be a thing of the past,” she added.
