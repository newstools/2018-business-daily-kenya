The Police have asked motorists to avoid roads around Sarit Centre due to smoke from a fire that gutted a section of the mall's second floor. Sarit's management said the fire, which started Friday morning, had been contained. “We would like to inform all our tenants and shoppers that there was a small fire in one of our outlets on the ground floor which has now been contained by Sarit Centre security, staff and the Nairobi County Fire Department. No injuries reported," the management said in a tweet. However, heavy smoke was still billowing from the building in the afternoon thus prompting the closure of Pio Gama Pinto Road, Ring Road and Karura/Karuna Road. "Motorists advised to avoid Sarit centre round about and use Lower Kabete to West Gate, Waiyaki Road to Chiromo and Parklands to Mpaka Road," the Police said in a notice issued on its official Twitter handle. Bob Morgan (BM) Security, the private firm in charge of security at the mall, earlier confirmed the fire incident saying: “Fire outbreak at Sarit Centre. No causalities reported. BM Security is on ground responding.”   There are still no reports on damage, injuries and casualties. The cause of the fire is yet to be established.
