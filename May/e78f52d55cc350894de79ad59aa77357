The county government plans to set up a Sh200 million CT (computed tomography) scan centre. Governor Paul Chepkwony said the project to be set up at the Kericho County Referral Hospital. The project which includes the installation of the 64-slide (high level) imaging machine, is expected to be complete in the next two months. The project is good news to patients suffering from various injuries. The initiative is a joint partnership between the national government and Megascope Healthcare, a supplier of medical equipment. Patients with injuries in the county are currently referred to private hospitals which are expensive, with the cost of scanning at an average of Sh30,000 per session. “Kericho is now one of the nine counties to have such a facility (in public hospital). Referrals made to Nakuru and Eldoret for imaging services will now cease. This is part of my commitment to turn Kericho into a health tourism hub,” said Prof Chepkwony. He said the cost of scanning will be waived for needy patients and rates made favourable for rest of the residents. County Executive Member for Health Shadrack Mutai said the Sh200 million covers construction, equipment and training of staff. “Proton therapy treatment centre will ease diagnosis of cancer so that treatment is initiated as early as possible. And as we do health specialisation in various ailments, Kericho will now be the next medical hub in the region,” said Dr Mutai.
