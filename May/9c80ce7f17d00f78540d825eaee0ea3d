The two countries' representatives handed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) papers to the AUC chairman, Dr Moussa Faki Mahamat, in Addis Ababa. “Definitely Kwame Nkrumah and Jomo Kenyatta must be proud of you and proud of us,” said Dr Mahamat, upon receiving the AfCFTA documents. Ratify agreement “We encourage other member states to follow your footsteps and ratify the continental free trade agreement,” he added. The AfCFTA protocol was signed by 44 African countries last March in Kigali, Rwanda during a special summit of African heads of states. Only 11, out of AU’s total 55 member states, were yet sign the protocol. Like any other protocol or convention, after the signatures of the heads of state, AfCFTA has to go through the legal process of each country to be approved as law and domesticated accordingly.
