President Uhuru Kenyatta Monday vowed to deal firmly and decisively with all unethical people caught in the web of corruption. The President, reiterating his anti-graft message, said all Kenyans entrusted with responsibility must be ethical and ready to serve with a high sense of morality. “We are not going to tolerate unethical people. People with responsibility must be ready to serve and not to be served”, said the Head of State. He said ethics is not about getting big positions of authority in government but how those entrusted with responsibility exercise that authority. President Kenyatta spoke at State House, Nairobi when he presented Kenya High School with a new 51-seater bus and gym equipment, all valued at Sh8 million. The modern gym equipment includes a treadmill, cross-trainer, tower machine, upright bike, roman chair and a recumbent bike.
