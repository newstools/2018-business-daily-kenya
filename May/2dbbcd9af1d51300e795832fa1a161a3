Former Kisumu County Speaker Anne Adul suffered a blow after her attempts to get Sh10.4 million compensation were thwarted by the Employment and Labour Relations Court . Mrs Adul, who was forcefully removed from office, had told the court that her rights were violated and that when she was thrown out, she lost allowances and other benefits. Mrs Adul is seeking Sh10.4 million following her unprocedural impeachment by members of the county assembly in 2014 that led to the Court of Appeal reinstating her. She later moved to court to claim the compensation, which she said was awarded by a judge who handled her case. But Employment and Labour Relations Court judge, Justice Nduma Nderi who delivered the judgment on behalf of Lady Justice Maureen Onyango said there was no proof the court that had handled the case issued orders on compensation. Justice Nderi said copies of the judgments were not in the court file and were missing in the affidavit that the petitioner had filed. He noted that during the submissions, her lawyer Elisha Ongoya made reference to the judgment having awarded compensation yet in the affidavit he referred to it as general and punitive damages. “I have no proof of what was awarded in the judgment to use as a basis of assessment of damages or compensation,” said Mr Nderi. Of the total compensation, Mrs Adul is seeking Sh2.4 million allowances she said she lost while out of office. She also wants Sh1.2 million for plenary sittings, Sh550,000 for assembly service board meetings as well as other amounts for other committee meetings.
