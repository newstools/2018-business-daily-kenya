President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday announced that the production of oil from the Turkana oil fields will start without any hindrance after an agreement was reached on the sharing of revenue. President Kenyatta said the revenue from oil will be shared on the basis of 75 per cent for all Kenyans through the national government, 20 per cent to the county government and five per cent will go to the local community. Mr Kenyatta spoke after a deal was struck on the Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Bill. "We now have an understanding that can put Kenya on the map of oil exporting countries. "We will intensify our exploration efforts not just in Turkana but in the rest of the country, now that we have a legal instrument that can help guide how oil and gas will be handled in our republic," he said at State House, Nairobi.
