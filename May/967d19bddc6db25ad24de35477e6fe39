Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has announced a voluntary early retirement plan for the city county workers. "Most of our staff are over 50 years old and will be retiring within 10 years,” he said  during this year's Labour Day Celebrations at Uhuru Park. “I have approved that Nairobi City County Government and the workers’ unions begin discussions on rolling out voluntary early retirement”. He insisted that the plan will be voluntary and no one will be forced to take it. "Let me stress that this exercise will be voluntary. No one will be forced to retire if they still feel that they have the energy to continue being productive," said Mr Sonko. Expensive "We estimate that the cost of the voluntary early retirement exercise will be expensive, but we will find a way to make it successful." The county, the governor said, has 13,000 workers. Though he said they were getting their salaries in time, he complained that "almost all the 12 billion shillings we collect from local revenues goes to salaries, leaving nothing for development." "Nairobi has embarked on recruiting staff that offer essential services. They include 800 constables and 200 firemen. All our staff have comprehensive health insurance for them and their families," said Mr Sonko.
