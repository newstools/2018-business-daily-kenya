Former Roads secretary Michael Kamau Wednesday declined to take a plea before a magistrate over the loss of Sh33 million, saying that the case was terminated by the Court of Appeal last year. Through lawyer Nelson Havi, Mr Kamau objected to plea taking, arguing that he cannot be subjected to new proceedings yet the charges were quashed. He said that subjecting him to fresh charges is an abuse of the court process. Alternatively, Mr Havi urged Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti to suspend the trial, pending an appeal he has filed at the Court of Appeal. “Both requests are reasonable and cannot prejudice the prosecution’s case,” he said. Mr Kamau was to plead to the charges on May 23 but failed to appear, forcing the court to issue summons against him. He faces charges of abuse of office and failure to comply with guidelines relating to the management of public funds. In reply, Senior Principal Prosecution Counsel Fredrick Ashimosi opposed the application, saying that the charges against Mr Kamau were withdrawn on technical grounds. He said the Court of Appeal refused to acquit Mr Kamau, hence the charges still stand. Two other suspects, former chief engineer Roads Mwangi Maingi and former resident engineer Nicholas Ndung’u, denied charges of abuse of office in connection to the redesigning of a road in Bungoma County.
