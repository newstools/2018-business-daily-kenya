The first phase of the Sh11 billion Dongo Kundu bypass set to decongest the Mombasa-Nairobi highway will be opened for public use by next week, the government has said. Phase one includes an 11km road between Mombasa port and Miritini. Plans are under way to build phase two and three of the bypass from July, which will connect the North Coast with the South Coast. When completed at a costs of Sh30 billion, the road will connect Mombasa Mainland West to Mombasa Mainland South without entering Mombasa Island. “Motorists will be allowed to use the first phase by next week. The works are now complete and we want to officially hand it over to the public,” said KeNHA Coast Regional Director Jared Makori. Mr Makori said the bypass will also encourage investors in the hospitality sector, “since they were shying away from putting their money in an area faced with serious transport problems.” It will also provide an alternative to the busy Likoni channel. Traffic snarl-ups at the busy channel often delay motorists. Phase two is 8.9km long from Mwache Junction to Mteza, while phase three is 6.9km from Mteza to Kibundani.
