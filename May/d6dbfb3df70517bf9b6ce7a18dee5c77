Turkana leaders will from today start holding public awareness meetings in Turkana South and Turkana East sub- constituencies over a revenue- sharing deal that was struck after three days of consultations at State House, Nairobi. The deal between the leaders and President Uhuru Kenyatta gave the local community five per cent allocation of oil revenues, the county government 20 per cent and the rest to the national government. The President is expected to flag off trucks of oil from Lokichar to Mombasa. But a section of Lokichar residents claimed they had not been consulted, pointing out that the deal came as a surprise since their leaders have been advocating for a 10 per cent share for the local community. Turkana South MP James Lomenen said all elected leaders from both the National Super Alliance (Nasa) and Jubilee were there to represent electorates across the county in the negotiations which he said ensured that the revenue allocation to both the county and local community would not be capped. “Any sub county where oil will be discovered will be getting five per cent each without capping. Turkana East and Turkana South sub counties will each get their share and also benefit from the county allocation and the national government one,” Mr Lomenen said. The MP said he together with his Turkana East counterpart Mohammed Ali Lokiru would ensure the local community understood the oil revenue- sharing deal to clear the air. Mr Lokiru said Members of Parliament would see that the county, which had been marginalised by successive governments, gets its rightful share from the national government.
