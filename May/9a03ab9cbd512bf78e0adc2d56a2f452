The Nyandarua  County business community has opposed a directive by governor Francis Kimemia to ban Sunday market days. The county government banned Sunday market days “to fight drug abuse”. But the governor has maintained that the directive stands, adding that he is implementing a memorandum presented to him by religious leaders. “Those opposed to the directive must flash back and see why they never get rich, it is because they have abandoned their God. They have time to worship and thank their God. God worked for six days. We are not relenting. We know they are opposed to the directive as diversionary tactic, but they are really opposed to the war against drugs abuse,” said the governor. He said in the past years, most market days were on Wednesdays and Saturdays, unlike now when each day is a market day. But led by their coordinator, Mr George Rugene, the traders termed the proposal as punitive to business people and customers,  whose only market days are on Sundays.Mr Rugene said some towns such as Kasuku in Ol Joro Orok constituency, Wanjohi in Kipipiri and Mairo-Inya in Ndaragua constituency rely on Sunday markets for survival. “Churches are well programmed where some conduct their services starting at 7 am followed by other services into the afternoon. Shopkeepers, butcheries and other formal traders rely on Sunday markets to do good business,” said Mr Rugene.
