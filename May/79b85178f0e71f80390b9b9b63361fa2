Milk processor Brookside is targeting schools in a new push to grow consumption of dairy products and expand its share of the processed milk market. The company Tuesday announced a partnership with schools that will see 300 institutions in Nairobi get free milk as the processor seeks to build brand loyalty. Oliver Mary, Brookside’s marketing director, said over 200,000 pupils in schools in Nairobi would benefit from the initial phase of the programme, which will be adopted in other counties. “Our school programme seeks to educate pupils and teachers on the importance of having dairy products as part of a healthy lifestyle and diet for effective learning,” Mary said during the launch at a Nairobi hotel. The programme dubbed “3 Dairies a Day” will use edu-tainment in form of an engaging, interactive and fun show to educate children on nutrition and the benefits of consuming dairy products for healthy growth and development. The strategy seeks to promote its products to children through cartoons in future Brookside milk packages. Last December, the milk processor signed a partnership deal with Walt Disney Productions allowing use of its cartoon characters on milk packets.
