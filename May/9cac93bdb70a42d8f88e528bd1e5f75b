The Kenya Ports Authority says it has not blacklisted any firm from participating in tendering or doing business with it. The authority notes that blacklisting of suppliers is done by the Public Procurement Regulatory Board. “Our attention has been drawn to a section of media reports touching on cancellation of a tender for building works,” said Mr Antony Nyamacha, head of procurement and supplies on Friday. According to KPA, the cancellation of the tendering process was on technicalities that were being addressed. Mr Nyamacha said that the same tender will be re-advertised where all bidders including those who participated earlier will be free to bid. The notice comes as KPA, its managing director Ms Catherine Muturi-Wairi and Mr Nyamacha have been sued by two companies over tender cancellation.
