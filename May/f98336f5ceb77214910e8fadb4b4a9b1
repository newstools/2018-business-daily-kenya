The Kakamega county government has signed a deal with Swedish company VR Holding AB to build a Sh3.5 billion, 2.5 megawatts waste-to-power plant. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya Tuesday said the county will donate 10 acres of land at Mung’ang’a in Shianda, Mumias East Sub-County, for lease to the company that will generate electricity from waste and create 200 jobs. Mr Oparanya said the project is based on new technology from Finland and will be set up through a joint venture between VR Holding AB and Woima of Finland. He said that the technology is scalable and has potential to raise power production to 500 megawatts in two decades. “We are happy that the plant has emerged at an opportune time where as a county we are focusing on achieving the Big Four Agenda which includes industrialisation that will help spur growth and development,” Mr Oparanya said during the signing of an MoU with the firms’ representatives. VR Holding AB President Victoria Rikede said the company would give priority to municipality waste. “The plant will create job opportunities and ensure growth in various sectors,” said the governor. He said that negotiations had been ongoing since 2015 and the firms will start building the plant in six months while power generation will begin in September next year. He said the plant will expand depending on the availability of waste, which will be generated from 14 counties including Vihiga, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Homa Bay, Kisii, Busia, and Kakamega.
