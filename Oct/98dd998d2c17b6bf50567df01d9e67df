Oil marketer Total Kenya Limited   has appointed Olagoke Aluko as managing director, replacing Anne-Solange Renouard, in the company’s board changes announced on Tuesday. This follows the resignation of Ms Renouard late last month, barely three years since taking over in November 2015. Her successor, Mr Aluko, has been the General Manager of Operations at Total Nigeria Plc. “Ms Anne Solange Renouard resigned as a Director and Managing Director of the Company with effect from the close of business on 1 October 2018,” the company said in a notice to the Capital Markets Authority.    Mr Aluko, a graduate from University of East London and from London School of Economics and Political Science is not new to the French-headquartered multinational having joined Total in 2000. He also once served as Chief Finance Officer of Total Guinea. He comes in at a time when Total Kenya has made sweeping changes to the board. Last month the company appointed Jean Philippe Torres, a French national as chairman of the board effective September 5, 2018. Mr Torres takes over from Jean Christian Bergeron another French national who resigned from the positon without the company giving any reason. In the half year period ended June 30, 2018, the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed oil marketer made a net profit of Sh1.03 billion from Sh958 million posted during the same period last year, being 8.06 per cent rise ALSO READ: Total Kenya's half-year net profit rises 8pc to Sh1bn
