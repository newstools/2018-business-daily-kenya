The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) has started automating its 19 motor vehicle inspection centres in its latest road safety drive. Officials said the automation that began at the agency's main inspection unit in Likoni aims to improve efficiency in line with the current global car inspection trends. NTSA central region deputy manager John Parteroi said the move would lead to a reduction in the number of staff working at the inspection centres to less than the current five. "The automation shall happen in all inspection centres in the country and its part of the changes that the authority is effecting in its efforts to ensure road safety and curb corruption in the transport industry. “It is an expensive project that at the moment I cannot confirm its exact cost," he said. Mr Parteroi said the agency plans to upgrade the inspection unit in Makongeni, Thika. He spoke during a road safety campaign targeting public service motorists in Thika. “We’ve recorded a 10 per cent increase in the number of accidents since last year. Most of these accidents were caused by human error,” said Mary Omari, commissioner of police in charge of operations.
