Plans for the construction of the second Nyali Bridge in Mombasa are a notch higher after the government identified three companies to partner with in its development. The government has shortlisted three firms, one of which it will partner in building the bridge meant to decongest the city. The project, which is being overseen by the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura), will be undertaken under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The three firms which have been shortlisted are Nyali Connect Consortium, IHI-Join-Acciona Consortium (IHI, Acciona Construction, JOIN (Japan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corporation for Transport & Urban Development) and Strabag AG. Kura communication officer John Cheboi said one of the firms will be selected for the actual works after negotiations. “It is the qualified firm that the government will get into a deal with. We want to start negotiations and see who can offer the best deal from the three,” said Mr Cheboi. Currently, Mr Cheboi said they are waiting renewal of the contract for transactions consultant, Deloitte to make further engagement. This is after the contract between the government and the advisor ended. “We are now waiting for the Treasury to either renew the contract of the advisor or if they will source another one so that we can continue with the plans,” he said. Mr Cheboi said they are set to get into agreement on the cost of the project and set the date for works to start. Other plans including the identification of the locations that will connect the bridge. The bridge will start from Abdel Nasser Road on the Island to join Links Road on the Northern mainland. It will pass near the Tamarind Hotel where the old Nyali Bridge was.
