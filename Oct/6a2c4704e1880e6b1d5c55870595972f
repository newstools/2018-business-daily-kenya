City Hall has banned graduation ceremonies in the county’s 229 pre-primary schools accusing teachers of using the events to swindle money from parents. County Education executive Janet Ouko said centres were between Sh1,000 and Sh1,500 per child, contrary to City Hall’s decision to provide free Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE). She said parents who were unable to pay risked seeing their children denied entry into primary schools. “We have received complaints from parents who are blackmailed to pay because they wouldn’t want their child to be left out of these ceremonies,” said Ms Ouko yesterday. City Hall through a circular sent Tuesday directed all head-teachers manning the pre-schools to immediately cancel any graduation ceremonies as institutions prepare for end term. “This is therefore to communicate ban on all ECDE graduation ceremonies especially if they want to attract a charge to the parents,” read the notice. The decision to ban graduation ceremonies comes months after the Mike Sonko administration abolishing levies that had long burdened parents in June. City Hall pays Sh3,850 for each of the 13,000 children in the 229 pre-schools backed by the county government to boost enrolment. Before the abolition of the the levies some nursery schools charged as high as Sh10,000 for every child, making it hard for parents struggling financially to provide basic education for their children.
