Nairobi governor Mike Sonko risks arrest for snubbing Senate summons over misuse of public money as pointed out in the report of Auditor-General Edward Ouko. This comes as the Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee fined the governor Sh500,000 after he failed to honour its summons for the third time. The issues raised covers 2014/15 financial year. “The committee therefore requires him to pay the fine from his personal account and not from that of the city county coffers. He has failed to respect the Senate and the expectations of his office,” said Mr Kajwang'. The governor is expected to pay the fine to the office of Senate Clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye by November 5. Mr Sonko becomes the second governor to be fined by the committee after the Senate ordered his Kwale counterpart Salim Mvurya to pay Sh200,000 for dodging the committee sessions. Consequently, the Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’-chaired committee has issued fresh summons for the governor to appear on December 3 or cause his arrest. According to Mr Kajwang’, the governor has not exhibited any courtesy to either apologise or offer an explanation of any kind over his failure to appear on July 4, August 6 and October 29. “We are not going to entertain insubordination and stubbornness of the governor and many others. “Accountability is not an option to ignore — it is not like a dental appointment where you can ignore at will. He must appear or get arrested,” he said. Section 19 (1) of the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act provides that where a witness does not appear, or appears but fails to satisfy a committee of the House, that committee may impose a fine not exceeding Sh500,000. “Dealing with the Senate is not an option and only mandatory when it comes to the allocation of revenue from the national government. “The governors have the responsibility to account for the public funds. Our brothers and sisters at the counties should heed this,” Mr Kajwang’ warned.
