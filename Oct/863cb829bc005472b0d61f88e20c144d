The government has declared October 10, formerly referred to as Moi Day, a public holiday following last year’s High Court ruling. Moi Day was removed from the list of national holidays following the promulgation of the Constitution in August 2010. However, a court ruling in November 2017 by Justice George Odunga reinstated the day to mark as a holiday on grounds its removal was in contravention of the Public Holidays Act. “Going by this decision therefore October 10 shall be a public holiday,” said the CS in a statement Monday. “Owing to the elaborate celebrations lined up for all our heroes on Mashujaa Day (October 20), I make no pronouncement on the manner in which October 10 shall be celebrated." Odunga observed that although Moi Day was not a national day, the celebration of that day as a public holiday did not contravene the Constitution. The court had observed that unless Parliament changes the law to scrap it or the Interior CS substitutes it with another fete, Kenyans would still observe the day meant to celebrate the second president, Daniel arap Moi. Odunga ruled that failure to observe the day would be an illegality and breach of the Public Holidays Act.
