The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) is entangled in ownership disputes involving 85 parcels of land, including 46 title deeds at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), Auditor-General Edward Ouko has revealed. The disputes affect seven airports and airstrips across the country. Mr Ouko has warned that the authority’s land is at risk of being lost, especially because the management does not have details of the disputes, including the value of land involved, the parties involved and the current status of the disputes. Kenya's premier airport, JKIA, tops the list with 46 disputed titles while Wilson Airport has eight. Mombasa's Moi International Airport has 10 disputed title deeds while Kisumu International Airport has three. Kitale Airstrip has two disputed title documents while Eldoret Airstrip has 13. Malindi Airport has one disputed title while in Nairobi KAA’s Embakasi land has two disputed titles. “In the foregoing circumstances, the authority’s land is at risk and it has not been possible to confirm that the non-current assets balance of Sh51,643,374,000 is fairly stated as at June 30, 2017,” Mr Ouko said in a qualified audit opinion of KAA's books of accounts submitted to Parliament. Mr Ouko says in audit findings dated August 7, 2018 that the existence of two title deeds for Kisumu International Airport could not be ascertained. Available records at the KAA headquarters showed that the authority has two title deeds for the Kisumu aerodrome title and no explanation has been given for the status. “No satisfactory explanation was provided. In addition, no explanation was provided as to why LR Municipality/Block No 1/21 for 362.9 hectares was reflected as negative,” Mr Ouko says. The audit also found that title deeds for Manda Airstrip and Ukunda Airstrip, valued at Sh135.8 million and Sh58.5 million respectively, could not be found, making it difficult to ascertain their ownership. AKA said the title for Ukunda had been submitted to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) on September 1, 2008 to facilitate investigations that had not been completed at the time of the audit. Mr Ouko also queried some Sh583 million indicated in the KAA's books as leasehold land balance for Moi International Airport, saying it was overstated by Sh45 million. “In addition, the original title reflects blank lease registration stamps No 7 to 12 stamped between June 10, 2003 and May 5, 2006 for which no explanation was provided,” he said. The audit also questioned the ownership of disputed parcels of land in Embakasi Village (0.867 acres) valued at Sh4.3 million allocated to a police station, two parcels of land within JKIA airport land (LR No21919 and LR 14231) which have been allocated to third parties, Wilson Airport land LR No 209/144443 where a private building has been erected and Malindi Airport land LR No 7669 that is allocated to a church organisation.
