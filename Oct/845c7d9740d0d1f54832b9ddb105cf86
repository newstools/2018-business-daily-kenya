Migori governor Okoth Obado was Wednesday admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital’s (KNH) private wing at around noon after falling sick at the Industrial Area Remand Prison. Sources said the governor had complained of stomach-ache for the better part of the morning before he was taken to the referral hospital. “We received him around noon and admitted him at the private wing. He is sick yes but not in critical condition. He is stable though I cannot reveal to you what he is suffering from because it is not allowed,” said KNH Clinical Services director Peter Masinde. Mr Obado has been in police custody at the Industrial Area Remand Prison in Nairobi since last week after he was charged with the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno and denied bail. He was charged with killing Ms Otieno, an offence he allegedly committed between September 3 and 4 at Owade in Rachuonyo, Homa Bay County. He is under detention at the prison until October 8. His hospital admission comes just days after the prisons department battled claims that Mr Obado was being accorded preferential treatment at the facility. In June, former Youth Affairs Principal Secretary Lilian Mbogo-Omollo was remanded over loss of Sh9 billion at the National Youth Service (NYS) and was said to have received VIP treatment at KNH. Her menu is said to have comprised fish fingers, beef stew, rice, chapatti and fresh juice, a far cry from the prison staple of half-cooked ugali.
