Plans to construct a second bridge at Nyali crossing in Mombasa gained momentum Wednesday after the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) identified firms to partner with under Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The three firms shortlisted are Nyali Connect Consortium, IHI-Join-Acciona Consortium and Strabag AG. According to John Cheboi, KURA communication officer, one of the firms will be selected for the project after negotiations. “It is the qualified firm that the government will get into a deal with. We want to start negotiations and see who can offer the best deal from the three,” said Mr Cheboi. Mr Chepoi added that they are waiting for the Treasury to renew consultancy services contract with Deloitte, which expired, to enter further engagement. Mr Cheboi also said they are set to determine the cost of the project and commencement date. The proposed bridge will be 500 metres to the east away from the current Nyali Bridge and approximately 520 metres across Tudor creek. It will start from Abdel Nasser Road on the Island and join Links Road on the northern mainland. The new bridge will pass near the Tamarind Hotel where the old Nyali Bridge was. The construction of the bridge is part of the larger Mombasa Transport Master Plan that will help reduce congestion in the tourism hub. The bridge will be an alternative link between Mombasa Island and the North Coast. The current bridge was built about 38 years ago and is the only road connection between Mombasa mainland and the island. It was built by the Japanese when the population of Mombasa was estimated at less than 200,000. Speaking in an interview, Mombasa county Transport Executive Tawfiq Balala said the bridge will help deal with traffic congestion experienced by motorists from the Northern Coast. Mr Balala said at least 70 per cent of vehicles coming to the Central Business District come from Links Road where the bridge will land.
