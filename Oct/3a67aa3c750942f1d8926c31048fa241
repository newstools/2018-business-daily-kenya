Amref Africa has selected two Kenyan start-ups to benefit from the Innovate for Life Fund Accelerator programme to further develop their innovation solutions to improve healthcare in Africa. The Innovate for Life Fund which aims to support African entrepreneurs to accelerate home-grown health solutions for the African market has been running for two years and is supported by the Elsevier Foundation. Kenya’s health management application maker Baobab Circle Limited and caregiving service provider Ujuzi Fursa Africa joins four other firms from Nigeria. Uganda and Zimbabwe. More than 300 start-ups were gunning for these top six spots. “Local solutions for local challenges is in the DNA of Amref Health Africa, which makes the Innovate for Life Fund programme such a good fit. For over 60 years we have partnered with communities and governments to improve health in Africa. This experience is invaluable for entrepreneurs,” said Amref group CEO Dr Githinji Gitahi in a statement last Thursday. The winning solutions include a phototherapy unit used for the treatment of neonatal jaundice in newborn babies, a diabetes and hypertension self-management application, a digital hospital waste management system, a health workforce development centre and highly nutritious baby food from local produce.
