A raid on Kenya Power   offices by detectives for a secret audit report triggered the prosecution of the firm’s executives for Sh159 million fraudulent payments to fake companies. Audit manager Charles Kipng’eno said the Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI) invaded his office and took away the report that was used to commence criminal charges against former Kenya Power managing director Ken Tarus and eight senior engineers. Mr Kipng’eno told the anti-graft court on Tuesday that the report was meant for internal purposes but the DCI went away with it. The audit revealed that 39 companies that secured multi-million shilling tenders at Kenya Power were not registered at the Attorney-General’s office. “In your report did you recommend the prosecution of any of these persons in court today?” Defence lawyer Dunstan Omari asked Mr Kipng’eno. “No I did not recommend the prosecution of anybody,” Mr Kipng’eno replied. He was testifying on the second day in the trial of Dr Tarus and Kenya Power top managers including Harun Karisa, Daniel Tare, Noah Omondi and Daniel Muga. Others are Mwaura Njehia, James Muriuki, Bernard Muturi and Everlyne Amondi. Dr Tarus is separately charged with failure to comply with the law relating to management of public funds as head of Kenya Power. Mr Kipng’eno told the court that some firms were awarded tenders without bidding, adding that due diligence was not followed. The accused have denied six charges and are out on bond. They are accused of entering into a contract with a private firm for the supply of transformers which turned out to be faulty. Prosecutors said the deal also flouted procurement rules for government entities.
