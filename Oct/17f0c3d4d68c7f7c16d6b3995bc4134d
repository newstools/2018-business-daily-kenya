Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) detectives on Tuesday raided the home of a well known witchdoctor in Machakos and recovered three stolen vehicles and 112 national identity cards. Annah Mutheu was arrested in her house in Tala, Machakos County, alongside one of her assistants. “Detectives, following a tip-off from members of the public, recovered one lorry, a Toyota Hilux pick up and a 'Nissan' matatu,” DCI tweeted. Mutheu describes herself as a spiritual healer, traditional doctor, herbalist, spell caster, witchdoctor, and native doctor. In 2017, she made headlines after purportedly making a cheating husband to be caught in the act with his sister-in-law in Nakuru at a lodge. The man’s wife sought MsMutheu’s help to bust her philandering husband. Ms Mutheu told journalists that the client complained that her husband was unfaithful and "locked them". On her Facebook page, the herbalist says she helps her patients enlarge breasts and hips and can also assist women to become pregnant and help boost business income. In a previous interview with a local newspaper, Ms Mutheu said the Bible helps in healing her clients and that she never misses church on Sundays. The 39-year-old mother of three, who prefers to be called the “Boss Lady”, revealed she has invested heavily in her house and looks, which in turn have attracted more clients. She estimates her home to be worth Sh40 million. She also has a fleet of cars and often jets in and out of the country.
