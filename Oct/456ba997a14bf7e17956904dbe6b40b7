A Chinese investor has failed to produce in court title documents to prove ownership of a parcel of land valued at Sh2 billion that he claims to have bought around State House area five years ago. Testifying before High Court Judge Elijah Ombaga, Mr Yu Donghui did not have receipts to prove that Catham Properties Limited, which he represents, bought the upmarket property measuring over two acres. Mr Donghui told the court that Catham wanted to put up an ultra modern multi-billion business centre on the disputed parcel that is being claimed by three companies. The firms staking claim over the land are Delta Haulage Services Limited, Samvo Limited and Catham Properties Limited. Former Lands Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu, now Kitui Governor, is said to have witnessed the ground breaking ceremony for construction of the multi-billion business venture. Answering questions from lawyers for Delta through an interpreter, Samvo and two state counsel for the Attorney General and the National Lands Commission (NLC), Mr Donghui said he has nothing to prove ownership after his title was cancelled by the chief lands registrar in September 22 2014. This is after its authenticity was challenged by Delta Haulage Director Mr Ali Mohammed Egal and Catham was left with nothing to prove ownership, he said. With the cancellation, the only title to property held at the Ministry of Lands is that of Delta Haulage Services Limited. The same is being challenged by Samvo Ltd in a separate suit. Those named as respondents in the case are Samvo Limited, NLC, Chief Land Registrar, Catham, vendors Christopher Mugoye Wamae and Alexander Kungâ€™u Maina - who handed over the deed to Catham in 2014. But the AG, who is representing the chief lands registrar, said the transaction was fraudulent and the government cannot indemnify Catham from taxpayers' money. The AG said Mr Wamae and Mr Maina were never registered owners of the parcel of land which was subdivided into two portions prior to the sale.
