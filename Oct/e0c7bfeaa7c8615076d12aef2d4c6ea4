About 2,164 public primary schools are yet to receive the free laptops more than two years after the launch of the digital literacy plan. Education secretary Amina Mohamed said the laptop plan faces various challenges including teachers not embracing the use of technology. She told Julius Melly-chaired House Committee on Education that 19,565 out of 21,731 schools had received the tablets. “Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology has installed devices at 7,256 schools while Moi University has reached 12,309. Overall, 1,067,745 digital devices have been installed,” said Ms Mohamed, adding that the majority of special schools had not received devices. Homa Bay has the highest number of schools that are yet to benefit from the project at 278, followed by Siaya (176), West Pokot (167) and Migori at 165. It is only in Elgeyo-Marakwet that all schools have the tablets. Lower primary public school teachers are not using technology in classrooms due to computer illiteracy, drawing attention to more than Sh30 billion spent on the purchase of the laptops for pupils. This is the last year of the laptop plan — one of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto’s key campaign pledges ahead of the 2013 elections that have not been fully implemented.
