Chemelil Sugar Company has now called on the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to implement a lenient tax recovery plan to enable the firm pick up after undergoing a turbulent period. Newly appointed chair Zedekiah Bundotich said it was unrealistic for the taxman to demand huge sums of payment while the mill is operating at half capacity. Speaking after being inducted at the firm on Monday, Mr Bundotich called on the government to consider writing off Sh1.9 billion accrued in penalty plus interest to allow the miller to pay farmers and transporters over Sh200 million accrued over the years. “We want to discuss with KRA to see the possibility of giving Chemelil a reprieve so that we can be able to use the funds to meet some of the very dire commitments like factory maintenance and payments to farmers and staff salary arrears,” he said. His concerns came as Chemelil managing director Gabriel Nyangweso revealed that the firm pays Sh20 million per month to clear the close to Sh2 billion and another Sh15 million to 20 million per month for the current tax depending on sales realised. The payment schedule was issued by KRA as one of the conditions to access their account, which was frozen from February to September. “We find it very difficult to pay close to Sh40 million every month as tax while the company is struggling to make a comeback after over six months-lull,” he said. The company started operations last month after remaining shut since March. Among other reasons, the firm was shut down due to dilapidation of some of its machinery and a dire cane shortage which hit the Nyando sugar belt region.
