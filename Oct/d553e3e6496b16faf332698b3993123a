An 80-year-old widow in Thika is a relieved woman after the appellate court ordered a land-buying company to return a Sh1.2 billion parcel of land to her. The Court of Appeal said in its ruling that the company, whether there was misrepresentation or not, some transfer contentious 85.3 acres of land to Langata Development Company, was null and void. In the matter, Ms Mary Wairimu Dames decided to sell part of her farm known as Mary Dale Farm, which was about 1,062 acres in 1989. The company’s directors identified the land and visited her house where it was agreed that the company would buy 672 acres for Sh23,500 per acre translating to Sh15,792,000. The terms were captured in an agreement dated February 6, 1989. But during the transfer, the measurements were drafted in hectares, which saw Ms Dames losesome 85.3 acres, now worth Sh1.2 billion. In their ruling, Justices William Ouko, Patrick Kiage and Agnes Murgor said during the transfer, it was strange, because the advocates and the surveyor managed to transfer an extra 85.3 acres without paying a cent for it. A title deed issued to the company on August 25, 1992 showed the land measured about 306.5 hectares. It has taken her 14 years to recover the land, after discovering the anomaly in 2004 when she received a rates demand from the defunct Municipal Council of Thika, which showed the acreage of her remaining land, which she still occupied, to be different from what it ought to have been. The judges said the transfer to and registration of the 306.5 hectares is the crux of dispute, because its acre equivalent is 757.3 and thus exceeded the agreed, paid for and consented to acreage of 672 acres by a significant size of 85.3 acres. “This appeal and the dispute that led to it is yet another example of the perfidious nature of human beings and their interactions which go to show that honesty and honour are at times in short supply,” the Judges said. High Court Judge Lucy Gacheru had in 2016, said that she was not persuaded that the company had been fraudulent, but nevertheless found that there was a mistake or misrepresentation as to acreage.
