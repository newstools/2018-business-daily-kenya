The National Police Service has dispatched two choppers to the Coast to ensure smooth running of national examinations. Coast regional police Commandant Noah Mvivanda said security agencies were adequately prepared to ensure credible examination. On Friday, security bosses and those from the education department met at Coast Girls High School in Mombasa to prepare for the tests. “We have two choppers standby to cover the exercise, one is stationed in Lamu and another one within Mombasa, in case there is a need for quick response. We would not want examination leaks, examination centres will be declared scenes of crime immediately it is discovered that there are leaks,” Mr Mwivanda said. The police boss warned parents, teachers, police officers and the candidates against engaging in examination irregularities. “We shall close those centres and declare them crime scenes and treat everybody, including our very own police officers as persons of interest in case of investigations. We are upto the task and we shall deliver clean and credible results at the end of the day,” Mr Mwivanda said. Each centre is manned by two armed police officers.
