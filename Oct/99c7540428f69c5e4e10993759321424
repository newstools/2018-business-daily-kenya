The government is upbeat that a global conference in Mombasa will boost tourism at the Coast besides endorsing the city as a safe business destination. The four-day 79th edition of the International Association of Travel and Tourism Professionals World Congress themed ‘Congress on the Beach’ has attracted more than 500 key tourism and hospitality decision-makers from across the world. The event at PrideInn Paradise Beach Resort and Convention Centre in Shanzu begins today to Sunday. “The congress has provided Mombasa with an exceptional opportunity to showcase itself as the preferred meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions destination,” said Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) chief executive Betty Radier. According to the KTB, tourist arrivals at the Moi International Airport between July 1, 2017, to June 30 this year grew by 29.6 per cent to 119,910 up from 92,526 in 2016/17. Cruise ship arrivals rose by 59 per cent to 2,778 compared to 1,743 in the same period. Dr Radier attributed the good numbers to improved security and modern infrastructure such as the standard gauge railway.
