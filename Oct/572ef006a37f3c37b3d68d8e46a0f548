A Sh550 million unit specialising in mother and baby has been opened at the Nakuru Level Five Hospital in universal health coverage drive. The facility named after the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta will offer services ranging from maternity, paediatric and gynaecological care to cancer treatment. It is expected to serve mothers in Nakuru and neighbouring counties such as Bomet, Baringo Narok, Kericho, Samburu, Laikipia and Nyandarua. The mother and baby unit has four theatres, newborn and intensive care units, gynaecology, kangaroo mother care and grower’s units. Nakuru level five hospital records between 900 and 1,000 births a month and the new facility is expected to serve at least 500 more patients. Speaking during the opening ceremony, Ms Kenyatta said a huge investment in health facilities is still needed to improve health services across the country. She called for increased budgetary allocation and donor support. She also rooted for the recruitment of more nurses to address staffing issues in public health facilities. “I applaud the county’s plans to deliver comprehensive healthcare services through the upgrade so that it too can better serve as the largest public health facility in the region,” said Ms Kenyatta. The facility is expected to employ more midwives, adding to the current 53 to cater for the additional patients.
