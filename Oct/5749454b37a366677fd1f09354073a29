Attempts to amend the Constitution to shift the election date from second Tuesday of August every fifth year to third Monday of December flopped in Parliament Wednesday evening. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, who initiated the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2018 failed to raise the two-thirds majority of MPs (233) needed to approve it through its Second Reading and final stage in Parliament. Before the vote was taken, only 187 MPs were present in the House in the first attempt by the 12th Parliament to amend the Constitution of Kenya 2010. “Accordingly, the House cannot proceed to vote on the Motion for Second Reading and therefore the motion is defeated. And that is the end of the matter (Bill),” National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi ruled. The Bill effectively lapsed and can only be reintroduced after the expiry of six months. The collapse of the Bill means that taxpayers have been saved the pain of shouldering the cost of keeping MPs in office for a further four months had the Bill been passed. Debate on the Second Reading of the Bill was concluded on Wednesday, October 3 and Mr Wamalwa asked Mr Muturi to delay its approval to allow him rally numbers needed to pass the Bill.
