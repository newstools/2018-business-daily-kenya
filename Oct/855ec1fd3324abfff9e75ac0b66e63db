A former senator has blamed National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi in court for loss of employment at the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. Halima Mohammed, in documents filed in court, argues that Mr Muturi acted outside his power as an ex officio member of National Assembly when he removed her name from the list presented to MPs for approval. The Speaker directed that Ms Mohammed be dropped after Funyula MP Wilberforce Oundo alerted the House that the former senator lacked 10-year work experience as required by law for a SRC commissioner’s job. “The petitioner avers that the decision to remove the name of the petitioner from the list of nominees recommended for approval as member of the SRC could only be done by an amendment of the report following a vote by the National Assembly,” says Ms Mohammed. She claims she that she met all conditions required for the SRC job including satisfying the National Assembly’s Committee on Finance and National Planning of her suitability and competence. She says her dream of serving as SRC commissioner was cut short on August 30 by Speaker Muturi on the floor of the house.
