Only one motor grader is working at City Hall, officials have disclosed, as concerns grow over slow pace of construction and rehabilitation of feeder roads along city streets and estates. County executive in charge of Roads Transport and Infrastructure, Mr Mohammed Dagane said three others equipment have various mechanical problems owing to City Hall’s continued delay in releasing Sh8.9 million to repairers. Mr Dagane on Thursday told the County Assembly committee on Transport and Public Works that one of the graders is held at the Panafric Vehicle Dealer over an outstanding Sh8.1 million for repair of City Hall-owned bulldozer. He added that the finance department is responsible for the delayed payment saying that he expects the graders to be released in less than three weeks. “... the funds that have not been available, that is why the graders could not be released on time. Hopefully in the next one or two weeks the graders will be available,” Mr Dagane said. One of the graders has defective steering wheel and battery and worn out tyres but City Hall is yet to issue a Local Purchase Order (LPO) of Sh1.19 million for its repairs. The committee further heard that the one graders serving the 85 wards constantly stalls over lack of fuel and at times is moved to other projects before completing rehabilitation some of the roads. The members however opposed plans to hire graders on a need basis, saying the City Hall should purchase new ones and save millions in contracting costly grading services. “I do not see the need to hire graders. The money can be used to pay for the three graders and save government money,” said committee vice-chair Mark Macharia, the ward representative for Umoja 1. Mr Dagane told the committee the county will buy a new equipment at an estimated cost of Sh25 million bringing to five the number of graders that City Hall have, upon release of the three held at various dealers and garages.
