A tycoon charged with attempting to bribe Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has been allowed to fly to the UK to attend to his daughter’s medical needs. Mombasa senior principal magistrate Henry Nyakweba handed the suspect one month to fly abroad, dismissing the Director of Public Prosecutions' (DPP) claims that Praful Kumar Premchand Saula plans to run away from prosecution. “I have no reason to even imagine that the accused person’s intended travel to the UK is a manoeuvre to escape, the reason given for the intention to travel is to a company a sick daughter. Though no medical documents were given, I do not think that a reasonable parent in his senses can feign illness of his own child,” he said The magistrate released Mr Saula to travel but on condition that he executes a Sh1 million bond as a guarantee of his return. Senior Mombasa assistant DPP Ingonga Mulele had asked the court to deny the suspect leave to travel arguing he is a flight risk and is likely not to return to Kenya to continue with the ongoing criminal proceedings against him. Through an Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the DPP said the suspect has not provided any authentic medical records to prove the ill health of his daughter in Kenya that would necessitate the treatment abroad.
