A politician who works as a civil servant is the latest Kenyan millionaire after hitting the Sh208 million jackpot prize offered by gaming firm SportPesa. Cosmas Korir, who failed in his attempt to capture the Konin parliamentary seat during the 2017 general election, won Sh208.7 million announced on Sunday. Mr Korir is the director of Agriculture in West Pokot County, earning less than Sh300,000. New betting taxes approved by President Uhuru Kenyatta on September 21 demand that those who bet cede 20 per cent of their winnings. This means the State will get Sh41.6 million of Mr Korir’s jackpot. “Congratulations on this achievement. I left home and came to the office and congratulate you. Your life has changed, I will personally meet you soon and we can then share tips on how you can use this money wisely,” SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri explained. This is the fourth time a Kenyan is winning the jackpot and the third highest amount to ever be won in the history of betting. To claim this Jackpot, Mr Korir correctly predicted the results of 12 football matches, including Burnley’s 2-1 win over Cardiff on Sunday. In May last year, Samuel Abisai won the first Jackpot of Sh221 million before three winners shared Sh115 million a month later. Gordon Ogada also claimed Sh230 million in a separate win earlier this year. Mr Kenyatta reversed the earlier law that imposed a tax of 35 per cent on betting revenues, and cut it to 15 per cent. The higher tax rates was meant to curb the rapid growth of on-line gambling, which was said to hurt the young and vulnerable. Industry executives say about 7 million out of 45 million Kenyans have registered for betting services.
