President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday promised that the government would deliver credible examinations, warning that anyone attempting to corrupt the exam systems would face dire consequences. The president said the government was keen on maintaining a trend of national exams that are free of cheating, by taking strong measures against any attempts to steal or leak the tests. He made the pledge when he opened the inaugural international conference on Early Childhood Development (ECD) and education bringing together all African nations. “My administration has taken bold measures to make examinations credible and I commend those who work hard and long hours to achieve this,” said the president. “I condemn those who insist on corrupting our exam system," he continued. He assured all students and candidates that they will be shielded from unscrupulous individuals whose wish is to take advantage of their situation. Boost early education The president said Kenya prioritises early childhood development with clear policies to support the education of children, listing steps the government is taking to bolster early education. He said children who are exposed to quality ECD and education stay longer in school, the reason government was taking the sector seriously. The president cited allocation of more funds to support research and knowledge sharing in the sector. He said the national government will work closely with county governments in supporting ECD and will include the interest of the pre-primary sector in its short and long term plans. He called on county governments, under whose docket ECD falls, to work closely with the national government so that no child is left behind.
