At least 440 assistant county commissioners and 3,400 chiefs will undergo mandatory paramilitary training in the next six months, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangâ€™i has said. Speaking during a security meeting with administrators in Nyeri County on Tuesday, Dr Matiangi said the training will be organised by the National Police Service. "We will ensure that all ACCs [assistant county commissioners ] and chiefs that haven't undergone paramilitary training do so in the next six months," Mr Matiangi said. The training is will see Administration Police officers who were previously attached to chiefs and assistant county commissioners redeployed. The exercise comes amid safety concerns for administrators following recent killings of chiefs while on duty in Turkana and Nyeri.
