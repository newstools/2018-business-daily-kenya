Three Kenyan exporters currently exhibiting their agricultural products in China could close monthly deals worth Sh125 million with Chinese buyers. Trueways is holding talks with a buyer for a Sh50 million honey deal atop their Sh2 million monthly export deal for wax candles while Primax Agri-products has a pre-signed deal worth Sh45 million for direct exports of five tonnes of coffee beans valued at Sh45 million to a China-based coffee roaster. Speaking in Nairobi during the signing of a memorandum of understanding to boost Kenya-China trade ties, China’s economic and commercial counsellor at its Nairobi Embassy Guo Ce said trade delegation exchanges would continue to facilitate new business ventures. Mr Guo Ce said Kenyan traders would next week have another opportunity to meet Chinese companies that would exhibit their machinery and other products at Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi during a four-day expo dubbed the China-Kenya Industrial Capacity Co-operation Fair. “This is a win-win strategy for Kenya and China-based on enhancing industrial linkages for development of both countries,” he said adding that 70 Chinese enterprises have confirmed participation as well as other firms from 30 African countries. Last year China exports to Kenya hit the Sh400 billion mark being 22.6 per cent of all imports compared to 2016 when it brought in Sh340 billion worth of goods. Kenya exported Sh10 billion goods to China last year.
