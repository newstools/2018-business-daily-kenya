The State has taken over 8.8 acres of land in Mwiki, Kasarani that were allegedly grabbed from a school and sold to unsuspecting private investors. National Land Commission (NLC) revoked the land title 8469/4/7 and directed the land to revert back to the school, a decision which will affect unsuspecting buyers. After the grad, the land was in turn amalgamated with another adjacent piece measuring 53.6 acres and sub divided into 552 parcels. Mwiki Company Limited, the land buying and selling company which claims ownership, has now moved to High Court to challenge NLC’s decision arguing that it had acquired the property legally. “The applicant Mwiki Co Ltd be granted leave to apply for an order of prohibition to prohibit the respondent, the National Land Commission, its servants, agents or in any manner whatsoever from interfering with the ex-parte applicant’s property comprised and known as LR No 8469/4/7,” reads order sought by the firm. Mr Robert Wariri, director of Mwiki Co Ltd, says that his company bought the two parcels from Mukinye Enterprises. He claims that his firm applied to Director of Survey to have the two parcels of land amalgamated and subdivided. He says all this process was carried out successfully, noting that his firm was surprised to learn that the amalgamation had been cancelled and the title to one of the parcels revoked.
