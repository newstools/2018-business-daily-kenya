The Supreme Court was on Wednesday urged to dismiss an appeal filed by Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud saying he has failed to table evidence proving that he holds a degree. Through Senior Counsel James Orengo, Ahmed Muhumed Abdi, who lost the seat to Mr Mohamud said it was still anyone's guess as to whether the governor attended classes at Kampala University or even graduated as he alleged. “The court has to tread carefully because you might end up conferring a degree upon somebody who does not qualify,” Mr Orengo told six judges of the Supreme Court. Supporting the argument, Senior Counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi for former governor Ahmed Abdullahi Mohamed cautioned the court against “elevating the question of a university degree into a constitutional issue”. Mr Mohamud moved to the top court after the High Court and Appeal Court ruled that he was not validly elected because he did not have a degree. Chief Justice David Maraga and justices Mohamed Ibrahim, J.B. Ojwang’, Smokin Wanjala, Njoki Ndung’u and Isaac Lenaola said they will give their judgment on notice.
