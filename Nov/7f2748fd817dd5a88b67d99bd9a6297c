A man who was being sought over a Sh140 million Dubai heist will be detained for 14 days to assist police with investigations. Mr George Gitau Maina who was arrested at his Mwihoko residence in Nairobi on November 6 will be held at Muthaiga Police Station up to November 21. “The suspect is being sought by International Police (Interpol) since March, 4 2018 when AED5million (Sh140million) was stolen while on transit at Dubai,” Senior Principal Magistrate Ben Nzakyo was told. The magistrate heard that an international warrant of arrest has been in force and the suspect alongside others said to be on the run are being sought. A State prosecutor said extradition of Mr Maina and his co-accused Ms Rebecca Mueni Musau, who was arrested in July 3, to Dubai is being processed as there is a criminal case that was commenced against them in the Middle East country. The magistrate heard that when Ms Musau was arrested at the Namanga border post trying to cross to Tanzania Sh13,130,000 was recovered. The money was retrieved from her Kamulu residence in Nairobi besides other valuables such as title deeds. She is said to have assisted police with crucial information. Like was the case with Ms Musau's arrest, some Sh240,000, as well as title deeds for parcels of land, were also recovered from Mr Maina's residence. The Inpsector General of Police (IG) Joseph Boinnet received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explaining that Mr Maina and other suspects left Dubai on March 4, 2018 with the stolen money. The money was stolen from a vehicle owned by a Dubai company Transguard Cash. It was being ferried to be stuffed into Automated Teller Machines. Investigations have been ongoing in Kenya and the United Arab Emirates. “ Investigators will fly to Dubai to piece together evidence before making an informed decision about the prosecution of the suspects,” the magistrate heard.
