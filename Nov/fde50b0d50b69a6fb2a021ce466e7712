Directors of the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA) risk punishment for allegedly interfering with the leadership and management of the 8,000-member Kiru Tea Factory in Murang’a County. Arguing before the Court of Appeal Thursday, Senior Counsel Paul Muite — assisted by lawyer Marete Githinji — asked the judges to impose fines and jail terms on each of the 14 directors for disobeying an injunction issued by the court prohibiting them from holding an AGM last December 14. During the AGM, members approved changes on the tea processor’s board. However, lawyers Njoroge Regeru and Waweru Gatonye — representing Stephen Maina Githiga and his group — said no elections were held to replace the aggrieved directors. The group led by Mr Githiga has insisted on being legitimate directors of the factory. Chege Kirundi and his group; including vice-chairman John Ngari Kariri and auditor Christopher Mwangi, have accused their rivals of trying to paralyse operations of the firm at the behest of powerful individuals who are seeking to control the tea industry. Justices William Ouko, Fatuma Sichale and James Otieno-Odek said the contempt proceedings, which were initiated by Mr Kirundi and his allies, will determine which group is lawfully in office. The judges will deliver a ruling on February 22 on whether officials of a splinter group and KTDA directors had orchestrated the removal of Mr Kirundi and other officials last year against the court’s orders.
