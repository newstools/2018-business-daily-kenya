Migori Governor Okoth Obado dismissed two of his top officials on Tuesday in a move seen as punishing political disloyalty. The two are Trade Chief Executive Elizabeth Ochaye and Education Chief Officer Marwa Muniko. Mrs Ochaye was sacked over claims of political disloyalty, having campaigned openly for Mr Ochillo Ayacko of the Orange Democratic Movement, in the senator by-election. Most of Mr Obado's supporters campaigned for Mr Eddy Oketch of the Federal Party of Kenya after the county boss openly differed with the orange party over the manner in which Mr Ayacko was picked. It was unclear why Mr Muniko was dismissed. Mrs Ochaye was replaced by Ms Sheila Ghati, who was previously in the public service docket. Mr Elijah Odhiambo will act as the county executive for public service management while continuing to run his land and housing department. Mrs Roseline Otieno took over as public service chief officer, replacing Mrs Mary Midida who was moved to the education department in the same capacity. The new acting chief officer for trade is Mr Samuel Ochiengâ€™, who will continue running the roads and public works department. Mr Moses Chamwada is now the environment executive while Mr Joshua Ngwala will remain the chief officer. Mr Obado retained Mr Christopher Odhiambo Rusana as the county secretary and Mr Samson Maginga as the education executive. Mrs Ghati Maroa is the water and energy executive with Mr Edward Kabaka serving as the chief officer. More changes are expected in the coming weeks as Mr Obado assembles his "legacy team". He is serving his second and final term. Director of Communication Mr Nicholas Anyuor, who announced the changes, said the Governor is committed to improving the services by all department.
