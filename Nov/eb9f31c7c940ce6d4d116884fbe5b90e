The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (Nacada) has said it is advocating for a ban on muguka in order to address the drug menace affecting millions of youth in the country. Nacada CEO Victor Okioma said statistics have indicated that muguka and alcohol abuse are among top substances that have ruined the lives of youths. Consumption of the drug, a stimulant that is cheaper than miraa, has been blamed for social ills including crime and increased teenage pregnancies rate. “Contrary to what many people believe that Coast region is being dominated by cocaine and heroin, we have come to realize that muguka, alcohol and bhang are now leading...their effects are out of control,” said Mr Okioma after inspecting rehabilitation centers in Malindi today. He said the anti-drug agency will meet other stakeholders in the country to brainstorm how to push for the ban of harmful drugs including the stimulant. “Let us join hands and discourage our people especially youths from takings these drugs...once one is addicted it has a long-term recovery. This comes as local leaders led by Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa also called for ban on muguka. Mombasa ward representatives in August proposed a ban on the sale and consumption of muguka due to its abuse by minors and the youth. Chaos The Samburu County government this month moved to ban sale of muguka and miraa in Maralal town. Officials blamed unruly Probox vehicles used to transport the addictive plants for creating chaos in the area. Nacada is mandated to carry out public education on alcohol and drug abuse in collaboration with other public or private bodies.
