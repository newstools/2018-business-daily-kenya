About 800 delegates will be attending the ICAO Air Services Negotiations event taking place in Nairobi between December 10 and December 15. The global event, which is in its 11th consecutive year is looking to provide meeting facilities for states to conduct multiple bilateral, regional or multilateral air services negotiations in a single location, thus sparing member states the trouble of making individual trips to each of the countries. The event which took place in Sri Lanka from December 4 to 8 December last year was attended by over 500 delegates. “ICAO Air Services Negotiations event will be taking place at Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC), from December 10 to December 15,” said Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) director-general Gilbert Kibe. Aviation standards “We will be working with various countries and industry groups to reach consensus on international civil aviation Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) and policies in support of a safe, efficient, secure, economically sustainable and environmentally responsible civil aviation sector.” About 142 states have participated in and benefited from ICAN at least once with over 2,700 agreements and arrangements having been signed between states and delegates. Other than the bilateral negotiations that will be taking place, there will also be forums for participants to learn about current trends, discuss share experiences.
