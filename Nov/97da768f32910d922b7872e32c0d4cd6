Bunson Travel, a Nairobi-based tour service firm, recently marked its 70-year anniversary in the hospitality industry at the Africa Heritage House in Mlolongo overlooking the Nairobi National Park. The celebration brought together industry stakeholders, as the firm's management promised to rope in a variety of quality services including embracing technology to meet its clients' needs. “Our business has been challenging just like any other business. But with team work and hard work coupled with a strong client base over the years, we have managed a fruitful journey,” said Julie Scott, the company's managing director. The family-owned travel and tours firm established in 1948, became the first Travel Agency licensed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in East Africa in 1950. It currently has a presence in Nairobi, Mombasa and plans to soon launch in Kisumu. Last year, Bunson Travel was appointed the exclusive Fifa World Cup sales agent for Kenya and neighbouring countries ahead of the 2018 World Cup, a lucrative deal that enabled the firm to cash in on the global sporting festival. The contract allowed the firm to sell tickets to football fans booking for the tournament that began on June 12 in Russia.
