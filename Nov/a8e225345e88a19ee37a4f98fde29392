Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James Macharia has confirmed Daniel Manduku to the position of managing director of the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). The former National Construction Authority executive director, who was appointed six months ago on an acting capacity, replaces Ms Catherine Mturi-Wairi who was sent on compulsory leave by the KPA board in May due to lack of effective leadership. “Following the submission of a short list of three candidates by the board of directors, and in accordance by section 5(1) of the KPA Act, Chapter 391 of the Laws of Kenya, I have appointed Dr. Arch Daniel Ogwoka Manduku as the managing director of the Kenya Ports Authority with effect from November 30, 2018,” said Mr Macharia. Dr Manduku was appointed to the position in an acting capacity on May 30. His initial two-month contract lapsed on July 31 but on August 1, the board of KPA extended it by four months up to November 30. The board had given him credit for enhanced efficiency at the port, increased cargo handling and a crackdown on illicit imports in collaboration with other agencies. According to Dr Manduku, the port generated Sh50 billion for the Kenya Revenue Authority in July, the highest in the history of KPA.
