County Speakers have petitioned Parliament to guard them against a wave of impeachments, which they claim are driven by county executives. The County Assembly Forum (CAF) has asked the Senate to design mechanisms that will safeguard their jobs and offer a platform for lodging appeals following impeachments. In a span of three months, three county assembly speakers and a deputy speaker have been impeached by members of the county assemblies (MCAs) on corruption claims. “We need the Senate to be the arbitrator such that after impeachment is done, the matter is forwarded to Parliament for consideration,” said Joshua Kiptoo the chairman of CAF’s Intergovernmental Legal Affairs Committee. Homa Bay County Assembly Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo and her Nyandarua counterpart Wahome Ndegwa are the latest victims of impeachment by MCAs. The two joined Nairobi County Speaker Beatrice Elachi and Embu Deputy Speaker Paul Muchangi who are battling ouster from their seats. Mr Kiptoo who is also the Nandi County Speaker told the Senate Justice, Legal Affairs and Human Rights Committee that county executives were using MCAs to frustrate speakers.
