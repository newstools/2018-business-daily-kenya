Meru County Governor Kiraitu Murungi says his government will start naming and shaming the worst performing executives in a bid to check staff who don't meet their targets. Speaking after overseeing the signing of contracts at the devolved unit's offices on Wednesday, the county boss said departments will be ranked based on performance every year with the best being rewarded and non-performers reprimanded. While noting that the performance contracts will tame idlers and absentee staff in the county, Mr Murungi warned each of his executive committee members to work hard not to feature in the worst performing category. “The performance contracts are exams that you set for yourself. It beats logic that you would fail to hit the target. I will study every contract in detail so that I can evaluate you well. We will conduct regular reviews to know those who are doing nothing. The performance ranking will be announced in a public event. Be careful not to appear at the bottom of the ranking,” Mr Murungi said. Experts County Secretary Rufus Miriti said the devolved unit had set up a performance contracting secretariat comprising of experts from the Ministry of Devolution and the Presidential Delivery Unit to evaluate the executives. “The performance contracts are meant to ensure just use of public resources and ensure we are more accountable to the people,” Mr Miriti said. Deputy governor Titus Ntuchiu said the performance contracts would improve performance of the county's 5,000 strong workforce. “I have had frustrations pushing people to do the obvious in the county. It will now be easy for staff to work without being pushed. We have no luxury of time in delivering our promise by the end of our term,” the deputy governor said.
