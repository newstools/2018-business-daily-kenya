Kiambu has increased land rates by up to 300 per cent for home owners and will start levying holders of agricultural land, dealing a blow to real estate developers. Stand-alone homes will pay between Sh5 and Sh12 per square metre annually depending on location, up from a range of Sh2 and Sh3—representing a threefold growth on the upper band. Rental apartment owners will pay between Sh10 and Sh12 from Sh8, reflecting a rise of up to 35 per cent. Industries will pay Sh10 from Sh8 while owners of commercial buildings and flats have been spared a rise and will continue paying Sh15 per square metre. The higher rates are contained in the latest Kenya Gazette notice and will shift the focus on Governor Ferdinand Waititu who had promised to cut the higher levies associated with his predecessor William Kabogo. Owners of agricultural land will also start paying rates on their holdings, with those owning less than five acres parting with Sh2,000 per acre. Those holding at least 20 acres will pay Sh800 annually The county government also introduced a new flat rate on agricultural land at Sh2,000 per acre for those with less than five acres of land. Large land owners will pay Sh800 per acre for area below 20 acres, in the new rates that have hit small land owners hard. “Agricultural land within the municipalities of Kiambu, Karuri, Kikuyu, Ruiru, Thika and Limuru (excluding Ndeiya. Nachu and Lari sub county), shall he subject to flat area rate as follows,” says the notice.
