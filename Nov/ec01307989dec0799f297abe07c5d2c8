Moi era Cabinet minister and a number of State agencies could lose their parcels of land in Kisumu as the county government moves to recover over Sh5 billion in unpaid land rates. The Kisumu Land Task Force team on Friday disclosed that the county was owed more than Sh15 billion as per 2014/15 valuation roll. A former Cabinet Minister and who also served as Alego Usonga MP Peter Oloo Aringo owes the county government some Sh300 million, according to Nicholas Migot, the secretary of the task force.” Mr Aringo did not respond to queries from the Business Daily via phone calls and SMS in regards to the claims. “Another former minister, Henry Kosgey, through a company linked to him; Kaburwo Investments Limited owed us Sh2.3 billion in 2014. However, from our current records, partly Sh84 million is reflected compelling us to forward it to other State agencies for investigations,” added Mr Migot. He said they would find out how the Sh2.3 billion was “illegally reduced to Sh84 million.” Mr Kosgey, like Mr Aringo, did not respond to queries following the allegations despite efforts to reach him via phone call and SMS. “We want to sanitise land administration and management in Kisumu to restore investor confidence,” added Mr Migot. Some of the institutions that owe the county billions of shillings from rates default include Kenya Airports Authority (KAA), Kenya Industrial Estates (KIE), Lolwe Housing Cooperative Society, Afya Sacco and Reli Cooperative Savings and Credit Society. “KAA owes us over Sh1 billion, while KIE, which claims some of its plots were grabbed owes the county government of Kisumu Sh215 million,” said Mr Migot. He went on: “Lolwe Housing Cooperative Society on the other hand owes the county Sh1.3 billion, Afya Sacco (Sh41 million) and Reli Cooperative Savings and Credit Society Sh155,000.”
