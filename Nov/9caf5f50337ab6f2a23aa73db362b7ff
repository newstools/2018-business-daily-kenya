Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has reinstated his chief of staff Peter Mugo, four months after he suspended him over alleged misuse of funds at City Hall. Mr Mugo has been under investigations by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, who undertook a probe into the alleged crimes following the suspension in June. Sonko instructed Mugo to report to work not later than Wednesday, warning that the lifting of the suspension does not exempt him from any sanction regarding the allegations of funds misuse.“I am under instruction to ask you to resume duty with immediate effect and not later than Wednesday 14 November, 2018,” read a statement by the deputy County Secretary, Leboo Ole Morintat that was sent yesterday. Mugo was suspended in June alongside Chief Officer of Finance Ekaya Alumasi and acting Head of County Treasury, Stephen Mutua, over misuse of public funds. Sonko’s move to reinstate Mugo leaves City Hall with two more senior positions to fill. Insubordination County Secretary Peter Kariuki is still on suspension over what Sonko described as insubordination after contradicting the governor on the conduct of workers at Pumwani Maternity hospital. Kariuki had defended the workers from allegations by the governor that they had failed to deliver services, leading to the deaths of at least 12 infants. Sonko is yet to fill the deputy governor’s position more than 10 months after Polycarp Igathe resigned, citing lack of trust from the governor.
