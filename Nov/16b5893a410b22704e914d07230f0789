The Kenya Roads Board has warned sugar millers transporting cane against exceeding recommended axle load which it says is leading to road damage. The Boardâ€™s Executive Director Jacob Ruwa called on implementing agencies to enforce weight limit to safeguard the multi-billion road network across the country. On a tour of completed projects in Nyanza region, KRB directors established that the trucks carrying sugarcane are notorious for overloading the product as they transport them to various sugar factories in the region. "This does not mean that other road users are left out. They will not be spared in the scheduled crackdown which will target factories based in southern Nyanza," said Mr Ruwa. The board established that some of the roads extensively damaged are classified under the Kenya National Highways Authority, Kenya Rural Roads Authority, Kenya Urban Roads Authority as well as county government roads. "It is unfortunate that the roads which were built less than five years ago have completely been dilapidated by individuals who have decided to operate in complete disregard to the law," said Mr Ruwa. But Kenha Nyanza region director Felix Osongo said they will launch night patrols next week as some millers have opted to transport the sweetener at night to avoid the dragnet. "We have now acquired equipment needed to conduct the surveillance at night and those who will be found flouting the rules will not be spared," he said. Mr Osongo said his officers would be stationed on key roads heading to Sukari Industries in Ndhiwa, Sony Sugar and Transmara Sugar Company in Kilgoris. Homa Bay Deputy Governor Hanningtone Orata said sections of Rodi- Ndhiwa road have become completely worn out due to years of misuse and abandon neglect.
