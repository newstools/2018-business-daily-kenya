The Ministry of Mining and Petroleum has appointed an interim managing director to run the scandal-dogged Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) on the day its former MD Joe Sang was arrested by detectives. Hudson Andambi, who has been an alternate Director representing the Ministry at the KPC board, will take the corner office as the board sits next week to pick a replacement from the management. Petroleum Principal Secretary Andrew Kamau said in a statement Friday that Mr Andambi would only stay for a ‘couple of days’ to fill the void. “He is only there to hold until the board meets next week to deliberate on the way forward, may be up to Tuesday or Wednesday and then he will be back to the Ministry. He is someone with a grasp of the place having been an alternate director for the board," Mr Kamau said. Mr Andambi is currently the Senior Principal Superintending Geologist and Head of Upstream Petroleum Operations in the Directorate of Petroleum where he also serves as the Deputy to the Secretary, Petroleum. His appointment comes after the sudden exit and arrest of Mr Sang who has been at the helm of KPC amid a storm of corruption allegations including massive fuel loss and procurement irregularities. Mr Sang, who wrote to the board on Tuesday to opt out of contract renewal next year, was meant to proceed on leave next week.
