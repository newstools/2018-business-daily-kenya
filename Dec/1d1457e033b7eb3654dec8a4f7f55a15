Kisumu County Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has prohibited washing of cars on the shores of Lake Victoria and along banks of rivers within the county. He expressed concern that waste form carwashes was choking the world's second largest fresh water lake and drying up rivers. “Henceforth, there shall be no washing of cars in the lake or any river within the county as we help to safeguard our blue economy. And that, believe you me, is an executive order,” he said during Jamhuri Day celebrations at the Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground. He said the county will partner with national government agencies like the National Environment Management Authority (Nema) to curb pollution which threatens the livelihood of thousands of resident relying on the lake. “The water towers are dying; the rivers that have been our irrigation enablers are drying up, raw industrial waste flow freely into our lakes, turning our beautiful blue water surfaces into habitats of menace like hyacinth,” he said. He asserted that the government will not sit by as the blue economy that has sustained the people for decades gets destroyed by poor business, industrial and farming activities. “We have just come back from the inaugural Sustainable Blue Economy Conference which was called to discuss sustainable ways of harnessing the potential of our oceans, seas, lakes and rivers to improve the lives of all of us.”
