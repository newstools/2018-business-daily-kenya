The High Court has ordered the Trade ministry to pay Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZ) chief executive his pay for four months starting September pending conclusion of the suit against the official's sacking. Justice Hellen Wasilwa directed Trade Cabinet secretary Peter Munya to pay Mr Fanuel Odede Kidenda, the immediate former EPZA chief executive, salaries for between September and this month. She further directed the minister to withhold the picking of George Makateto to replace Mr Kidenda pending the outcome of a labour dispute filed by advocate Dunstan Omari. Mr Omari in a petition filed under a certificate of urgency said Mr Munya sacked the former EPZA chief verbally. “We have agreed to withhold the appointment of Mr Makaketo as the CEO of EPZA until this case is heard and determined,” he told the judge. Justice Wasilwa suspended the appointment of Mr Makaketo as the chief executive of State agency until the case is heard and determined on February 6. Mr Omari told the judge that he would be asking the court to quash Mr Munya's sacking of Mr Kidede without following the due process. “Mr Kidenda was relieved his duties by Mr Munya during his maiden tour to the EPZA in Athi River on September 20,” Mr Omari told the judge. The advocate said former Trade minister Adan Mohamed had renewed the claimant's employment contract in July for a three-year period.
