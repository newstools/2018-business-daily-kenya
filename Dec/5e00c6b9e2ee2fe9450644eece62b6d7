2018 was momentous. Through news editorial photography, we get to see images of the biggest newsmakers at their greatest moments and their lowest lows. In Kenya, and indeed elsewhere around the world, politicians and top public figures bite off the largest chunk of news coverage. For this reason, curating a list of memorable images that does not wholly consist of these two groups can be an arduous task. A truly representative list of memorable photos from this year involves a mix of stories from historic events with people you already know, and those you did not get to see, but that you ought to. ----------------------                                                                                               Seen any photos or events that should have made the list?
