The move to have an East African Community (EAC) international passport has hit a snag in Uganda after MPs blocked it over its legality and the cost to users. In 2016, EAC leaders agreed to upgrade the EAC passport from a regional to an international document, with Kenya and Tanzania launching it last year. Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan were given until January 2019. On Tuesday, Uganda launched the passport that costs an ordinary holder about Ksh7,187 ($70 or £55) — up from Ksh4,107$40. The MPs, including Jacob Oboth, Michael Tusiime, Waira Majegere, Anifa Kawoya and Francis Mwijukye, queried the loyalty of some states to the community, and the laws under which the e-passport was issued. Interior Minister Obiga Kania promised to answer all the concerns next week.
