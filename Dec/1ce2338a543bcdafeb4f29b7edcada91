A man was Wednesday charged with fraudulently obtaining Sh1.6 million from a trader alleging that he could offer him a tender to supply 116 computers to State House. Mr Fredrick Muhanji alias Douglas Simiyu allegedly obtained the money from Ms Beatrice Mainga at Kilimani, Nairobi between September 1 and October 8. The court heard that Mr Muhanji, who identified himself as a senior National Intelligence Service officer based at State House, was looking for bidders to supply Sh9 million HP computers. Ms Mainga was introduced to him by a friend and they later met at a city hotel where Mr Muhanji demanded the cash as commission. To fast-track the process, Ms Mainga deposited Sh300,000 into an account given by Mr Muhanji and later topped up with Sh1 million, to secure the tender. But when he appeared before Principal Magistrate Martha Mutuku, Mr Muhanji denied the charges and was freed on a Sh1 million bond with a surety of similar amount and an alternative cash bail of Sh500,000. His lawyer had sought to have plea taking deferred to Friday saying Mr Muhanji was required at Kiambu Law Courts for another case. The suspect is facing similar charges before a Kiambu and Kakamega courts and is out on bond. Hearing is set for January 28.
