Former President Daniel arap Moi was Wednesday afternoon admitted to Nairobi Hospital for a routine check-up, his handlers said in a statement, the second time he has visited a medical facility this year. A brief statement from his office indicated Kenya’s second president will be monitored closely by doctors for a few days. “His physician, Dr David Silverstein, said the former president will spend a couple of nights in the hospital to accord the doctors enough time to carry out their investigations,” the brief read. It did not disclose the nature of medical check-ups the 94-year old former head of state would undergo. Mr Moi has largely resorted to a quiet private life in recent years, but his health has largely been stable. His last admission for a medical check-up was on March 11 when he was flown to a hospital in Tel Aviv after experiencing discomfort in his knee. His stay in Israel’s second most populous city after Jerusalem lasted for six days after doctors gave him a clean bill of health and even visited historical sites in that country. Mr Moi, Kenya's longest-serving head of state having led the nation for 24 years, has largely kept off political debates in public but occasionally hosts high-profile political leaders at his Kabarak home in Nakuru.
