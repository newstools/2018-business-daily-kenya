The world's largest aerospace company Boeing International has picked two female Kenyan students to join its internship programme in Seattle, USA. The six-month International Business Internship Program (IBIP) will see Aogah Winnie Achieng and Monica Nyawira Kang’uru join the training which will see them work alongside Boeing employees starting next month. Aogah Winnie Achieng is a business management student from Moi University majoring in Aviation while Monica Nyawira Kang’uru is from the University of Nairobi School of Economics. “I am excited for them to start in January, it’s a great opportunity to gain valuable work experience, not only in a new country but also at the world’s largest aerospace company,” said Boeing’s director of International Sales for Commercial Airplanes in Africa Miguel Santos. Launched in 2012, IBIP gives valuable exposure to Boeing’s latest advances in business and technology, with hands-on experience of a variety of disciplines, including business operations, finance, marketing and strategy in the aviation industry.
